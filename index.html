The first astronauts for China’s new space station are due to blast off for the country’s longest crewed mission to date, a landmark step in establishing Beijing as a major space power.
The trio will launch on a Long March-2F rocket for the Tiangong station, where they will spend three months.

The number of EU citizens searching for work in Britain has fallen by more than a third since Brexit, according to a study that exposes the impact on UK employers as they struggle to recruit staff.
Figures from the jobs website Indeed show searches by EU-based jobseekers for work in the UK were down by 36% in May from average levels in 2019. Low-paid jobs in hospitality, the care sector and warehouses recorded the biggest declines at 41%.

Social media stars Jodie Marsh, Chloe Khan, Lucy Mecklenburgh and Chloe Ferry have been named and shamed by the UK advertising watchdog for repeatedly flouting social media advertising rules, and face being fined or having their posts deleted.
The Instagram stars have become the first influencers to be named on a dedicated roll call of offenders launched by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA added that if they did not start to follow the rules, further sanctions could include online ads shaming them,the removal of their posts or financial penalties.

Concealed by the turbid, swirling waters of the Amazon, the Mekong and the Congo, the biodiversity of the world’s great rivers has largely remained a mystery to scientists. But now a multimillion-pound project aims to describe and identify the web of life in major freshwater ecosystems around the world with “gamechanging” DNA technology.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and UK-based environmental DNA (eDNA) specialists NatureMetrics have launched a partnership to take thousands of water samples from freshwater river systems like the Ganges and the Niger delta to identify the fish, birds, amphibians and land animals that live in and around them.

British travellers who have had two Covid vaccines could be allowed quarantine-free entry into England under plans being considered by ministers, the Guardian understands.
As the government grapples with allowing more trips abroad while trying to prevent the importation of new variants, changes are being considered to the traffic light system under which places are graded according to their Covid case and jab rate, determining whether and how people coming from them must isolate.

More than half of European cities are still plagued by dirty air, new data shows, despite a reduction in traffic emissions and other pollutants during last year’s lockdowns.
Cities in eastern Europe, where coal is still a major source of energy, fared worst of all, with Nowy Sącz in Poland having the most polluted air, followed by Cremona in Italy where industry and geography tend to concentrate air pollution, and Slavonski Brod in Croatia.

The size of the fine imposed on the former casino executive Rodney Baker and his wife, the actor Ekaterina Baker, on Wednesday prompted frustration amid members of the White River First Nation, many of whom wanted the couple to face stiffer repercussions.

                    <span>This masterful, mind-boggling film gets up close with the scientists who huddled over computers in their PJs to save millions of lives. The wonder of it!
There is a dizzying sense of scale imparted by the Horizon special on the coronavirus vaccine. On the one hand, you have the pathogen – so tiny as to be invisible to the naked eye even as it replicates by fatal millions inside a host, although the damage it does is all too apparent. And then you have the uniting of entire continents’ worth of scientists, each with a world of knowledge to bring to the fight against the microscopic enemy. The wonder of it, the harnessing of intellectual might, the logistics, the commitment necessary to condense into months what could easily have taken a decade was all powerfully evoked by Horizon’s 90-minute film The Vaccine (BBC Two). Plus, it did all that without getting in the way of the science, the facts or the story itself.
And what a story. Horizon begins with Dr George Fu Gao of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who first read on 30 December 2019 that something was happening in Wuhan. He got samples from patients, used next-generation sequencing technology to identify a new pathogen behind a new disease within days, and released the information globally so that those five continents’ worth of virologists could get to work. Dr Teresa Lambe of Oxford University remembers “huddling over my computer in my pyjamas, designing a vaccine”. That was on 1 January 2020.

Harry Maguire has declared himself fit and available for England’s Euro 2020 match against Scotland on Friday. The Manchester United captain had previously targeted the final group game against the Czech Republic next Tuesday for his comeback from ankle ligament damage.
Having returned to training with the England squad last Thursday, he has pushed on quicker than expected and he says that it will now be up to Gareth Southgate whether he is selected. England go into the Scotland match with their tails up after Sunday’s 1-0 win against Croatia. Scotland lost 2-0 to the Czech Republic on Monday.

It was not supposed to be this way. When Scotland qualified for Euro 2020, Kieran Tierney was earmarked as one of the stars of the team. The nation’s return to a major tournament was viewed as Tierney’s latest chance to display his talents on a grand stage.
Instead, when Scotland took on the Czech Republic at Hampden Park on Monday, Tierney was confined to a hotel room near Darlington. A calf problem, which may also keep the defender out of Friday’s meeting with England, meant Tierney could not even travel to support his teammates as they slipped to a 2-0 defeat. He does nothing to mask his disappointment.

Eddie Jones has held Cristiano Ronaldo up as the example to follow for England’s bright young things as the head coach sets about unearthing players capable of taking leading roles at the 2023 World Cup.
Jones has selected 22 uncapped players in a provisional squad for this summer’s fixtures with training getting under way this week in Teddington. Players from the four Premiership semi-finalists are still to be added before the Tests against USA and Canada, but with 12 senior stars away with the British &amp; Irish Lions – and several more rested – Jones is ready to give a number of youngsters their shot.

A little after 6pm local time, Christian Eriksen may well expect the windows of his temporary lodgings to start shaking. He can see Parken, Denmark’s national stadium, from his room in Rigshospitalet and one can only imagine how dislocating it must feel to watch thousands of red shirts funnel through the glorious summer heat while his teammates prepare to face Belgium inside. On the off chance he could not hear the fans before, their noise will resonate loud and clear in the 10th minute of the game: play will stop and they will rise as one to acclaim their No 10 in a show of appreciation, love and sheer relief that he is listening at all.
“It is a crazy situation for him to be in,” said Kasper Hjulmand, the Denmark head coach. Eriksen should have been out there doing what he has done since 2010, making his side tick.

                    <span>This is not a drill. Six days into Euro 2020, Italy became the first team to qualify for the knockout stages courtesy of two brilliant goals from Manuel Locatelli and another from Ciro Immobile, and a display of collective strength that should put the rest of the field on notice. Spirited and united, quick on the ball and ravenous without it, efficient and entertaining, this Italy team has been the revelation of the tournament so far, and here Switzerland had no answers.
There is something of Liverpool’s 2019-20 title winners in Roberto Mancini’s Italy side, a thoroughly modern 4-3-3 formation with daringly high full-backs, brilliant pressing wingers and an ability to control possession without ever fetishising it. Amid a carnival atmosphere at the Stadio Olimpico, Italy put the game to bed within an hour, stretching their unbeaten run to 29 games, of which the last 10 have been clean-sheet wins.

Appointment would be controversial given Liverpool links

Rafael Benítez is hoping to receive a formal offer to become Everton’s new manager after holding positive talks with the club.
The Spaniard has emerged as a candidate for the post, which has been vacant ever since Carlo Ancelotti’s shock return to Real Madrid at the start of the month. Everton’s board, led by majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, have mulled over a number of candidates and looked set to hire the former Wolves manager Nuno Espírito Santo. But subsequent reservations within the club’s hierarchy regarding the suitability of the Portuguese has led to Benítez becoming the frontrunner.

An Australian woman who was allegedly raped at knifepoint in an Airbnb apartment in New York received a secret settlement of $7m which included restrictions on what she could say about the incident, according to a media investigation into the vacation listings giant’s “guest safety” policies .

Robert Page praised Gareth Bale’s character after the Wales captain recovered from a penalty miss to help put his country on the verge of qualifying for the knockout stages of Euro 2020.
Bale squandered a chance to double Wales’s advantage but had laid on Aaron Ramsey’s opener and then set up Connor Roberts to earn a crucial 2-0 victory against Turkey.

Speaking after their first face-to-face summit, Biden said he had made clear the Kremlin had to “abide by the rules of the road” or face unspecified consequences. Putin was aware the US possessed “unrivalled” cyber capacities, Biden stressed.

Entomologists from the state and US Agriculture departments said it’s the first confirmed report from Snohomish county, north of Seattle, and appears to be unrelated to the 2019 and 2020 findings of the hornets in Canada and Whatcom county, along the Canadian border, that gained widespread attention.

Heather Knight fell agonisingly short of becoming the first Englishwoman to score a Test century since she herself achieved the feat in 2013, with the captain trapped leg before wicket for 95 by her former Western Storm teammate Deepti Sharma in the 79th over of the first day of Test cricket between these sides since 2014.
Knight, who arrived at the crease shortly before lunch, batted for two sessions in a chanceless innings that was dominated by her beautifully timed cover drive.

                    <span>Bruno Garcia-Cruciani’s murder of Julie Douib in Corsica became a rallying call against domestic killings
A man who murdered the mother of their two children on the island of Corsica in March 2019 has been sentenced to life in prison in a case that caused an outcry over domestic killings of women in France.
Julie Douib was shot dead by her former partner of 14 years, Bruno Garcia-Cruciani, a few days after learning that prosecutors had closed a case she brought against him for threatening behaviour, harassment and assault.

More than half the trees in two new woodlands in lowland England have been planted not by landowners, charities or machines but by jays.
Former fields rapidly turned into native forest with no plastic tree-guards, watering or expensive management, according to a new study which boosts the case for using natural regeneration to meet ambitious woodland creation targets.

                    <span>We knew Trump sought to use the neutral administration of justice as a tool for settling scores with enemies. But the scope of the operation is disturbing
In 1941, the German Jewish lawyer and political scientist Ernst Fraenkel published a slender volume called The Dual State. One of the first scholarly treatments of the Third Reich, Fraenkel understood Hitler’s state to be characterized by an unusual “dual” character. In large measure, the state operated by arbitrary decree – something Fraenkel called rule by “prerogative”. This “prerogative state” essentially functioned as a form of institutionalized lawlessness. At the same time, the Third Reich also maintained elements of a “normative state” – that is, an administration of justice that remained, at least formally, bound by operative law.
Without drawing any false equivalence with the Nazi state, we can say that the Trump administration likewise demonstrated this dual aspect. This emerges with disturbing clarity in recent reports documenting the lengths Donald Trump went toward turning the Department of Justice (DoJ) into a partisan tool. The Department of Justice, we must bear in mind, is a vast agency with more than 100,000 lawyers, many of whom are exceptionally skilled and principled civil servants dedicated to upholding the rule of law. Yet the reports of the past week make clear how loyalists installed in key positions can rather radically deform the administration of justice while remaining within the formal confines of the law.

                    <span>The government’s obstinate refusal to treat the EU as a valued trading partner is making Britain poorer
The agreement reached with Australia this week is celebrated by the UK government as a landmark trade deal – the first that isn’t a rollover of old European Union membership terms. But that honour surely belongs to a treaty that was signed by Boris Johnson in December 2020. It is the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) covering the exchange of goods between Britain and 27 other nations.
But those nations constitute the European single market, which Mr Johnson does not appear to count as a valuable trading partner, despite its proximity.

                    <span>The legacy of the radical bike-riding clubs of a century ago lives on
Cycling’s radical traditions are part of Britain’s social history. Recalling her teenage years in the 1890s, the great suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst wrote beautifully about the band of carefree lefties with whom she rode out of Manchester each weekend. Criss-crossing rural Lancashire and Cheshire, her cycling club was one of many associated with the Clarion, a popular socialist weekly newspaper. The more earnest socialists of the time saw this crowd as ideological dilettantes, too keen on having a good time. And their trips do seem to have been rather fun.
While there was some political evangelism and propagandising, “good fellowship” was the main object of the exercise: “At our journey’s end,” Pankhurst wrote in a 1931 edition of the Clarion, “was always an enormous shilling tea, in which phenomenal quantities of bread and butter and tinned fruit disappeared, then a walk round and frequently afterwards a brief ‘sing-song’.” A favourite anthem was a marching song written by the utopian socialist Edward Carpenter. “England, arise! The long, long night is over” resounded outside many rural pubs on Sunday afternoons. How many regulars were converted to the cause is not clear.

Tell us something we didn’t know. One of the comforts – or disappointments, according to your taste – of Dominic Cummings’ 7,000-word blog, published online shortly before prime minister’s questions, is finding that everybody behaved exactly as you would expect.
So when we learn that Boris Johnson thought Matt Hancock was “totally fucking hopeless” in the early months of the pandemic, that the government was too slow to lockdown and that Johnson himself was useless at chairing meetings, preferring instead to avoid all confrontation before leaving the room singing Rule, Britannia!, it hardly comes as any great shock. Good though the detail may be.

I have recently been diagnosed as having high-functioning ASD, what used to be called Asperger’s. It is helpful, as I approach 60, to understand why relationships, social situations and oral communications are so challenging for me, particularly in the work context.
But many seem to express the view that “everybody has a diagnosis these days”. Others remain discriminatory, so at this stage I’ve only told one person – a friend in the UK (herself diagnosed as bipolar). Do I tell a manager at work? My teenage children? My partner?

John Harris is right (Enough ‘autism awareness’. The necessity now is action, 13 June). It is now time that we had some action to improve lives for autistic people. Is it time to move on from autism awareness, though? I think not. Without a general knowledge of what constitutes autism and what people with autism live with, and without an understanding that each person with autism is different and will need a unique approach, there will be no useful action.
I work for families who have an autistic child and who are worried about their experience of school. This work is largely in mainstream schools, where the majority of children with autism are educated. Generally, the effort made by the school to understand both the condition and how it affects their particular pupil is dismal.

                    <span>Those who think socialism is irrelevant should leave the National Clarion Cycling Club and form their own club, says Jim Grozier. For Charles Jepson and his breakaway organisation, the link between cycling and socialism is unbroken
Those behind the recent “coup” in the National Clarion Cycling Club (Keir Hardie’s cycling club jettisons socialism, 14 June) have, like so many others nowadays, misunderstood the concept of inclusion, treating it like a mantra to be trotted out without actually thinking. Inclusion can only be invoked in order to remove irrelevant obstacles to joining an organisation.
For almost all organisations, gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and many other attributes are irrelevant, so they should not be an obstacle. Not so when it comes to political leanings in the context of an overtly political cycling club. One might as well try to persuade the Spurs supporters’ club to admit a card-carrying Arsenal fan. Those who are so unaware of the current political situation as to think socialism “irrelevant” should do the decent thing, leave the Clarion and form their own club, to which they would then be free to invite whoever they wish.

                    <span>Brexit minister Lord Frost asks for ‘a bit of breathing space’ to negotiate deal and head off trade war

The UK has asked the EU to suspend an imminent ban on the sale of British sausages in Northern Ireland to give both sides “breathing space” to negotiate an agreement on the Brexit protocol and avert a trade war.
Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, was speaking days after Boris Johnson warned he would do “whatever it takes” to protect Northern Ireland’s position as part of the UK.

An MP who miscarried her first child last year says women should not have to endure three miscarriages before receiving support, before a debate on the subject in parliament.
Olivia Blake, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, spoke in parliament last year about going to A&amp;E on her own in early pregnancy while her partner had to wait in the car due to Covid restrictions. She described the isolating experience of “being unable to have a hug or someone to hold my hand or support me on hearing the news that I was having a miscarriage”.

                    <span>For fair-weather supporters tournaments offer a taste of the pain – as well as the joy – of being a seasoned follower
Football is about pleasure and pain, a zero-sum ball game. The level of joy we feel at a goal or a victory is mirrored precisely in the pain of others. This pain is, in a sense, at the heart of football fandom; for without despair, there can be no joy.
I recall Colin Moynihan, as minister for sport in the last years of the Thatcher government, saying something well-meaning, but specious about football. It was along the lines of the game being a good thing for the economy because when their team won, its supporters’ productivity would improve. Didn’t they have spads in those days? Surely someone should have explained that the opposite would also apply for the productivity of supporters of the losing side. If he had been a passionate fan of a club, he would have known this to be true.

France and Spain are moving to ease rules around wearing face masks outside, in a development attributed by both countries to their Covid-19 vaccination campaigns.
In France, people will no longer be required to wear masks outdoors from Thursday, though they will still be obligatory on public transport, in sports stadiums and other crowded places. A nightly curfew will end as of Sunday.

                    <span>Reappointing the TV journalist in 2016 was bad enough, but the report clearing staff over this matter is embarrassing
For many years, as head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, the first thing I did every morning was read the Daily Mail or, on my day of rest, its sister paper, the Mail on Sunday. I’m guessing from the revelations this week that that isn’t something top BBC News executives do.
I read the Mail because it carries a lot of great stories, many of them actually true. Also, what the Mail says today, a Conservative politician is likely to say tomorrow and I like to hear news first from its true source. In contrast, it seems some BBC News supremos know nothing at all about some major stories, even when those stories are about their own institution, if they have not been broadcast on the BBC.
This week the BBC published a hilarious report into how on earth, or indeed in heaven, they managed to appoint as their religious affairs correspondent one of the most notorious television journalists of our time, Martin Bashir, and then promote him to editor, religion – which in British establishment terms is just one step down from the Archbishop of Canterbury. Some have asked if it was part of an evil BBC cover-up, but even Satan himself would draw the line at something this ridiculous.

                    <span>‘The landlady was shocked to see them – and their hair’
It was 1986 and I’d been on the road with Sigue Sigue Sputnik for a couple of days. They’d played a gig in Leeds the previous night and we’d just arrived at a little bed and breakfast in Newcastle upon Tyne. I dumped my stuff in my room and went down to the bar where I got speaking to the landlady. I was kind of just hanging around when two members of the band, Neal X and Yana YaYa, came down to order drinks. The landlady hadn’t seen them at this point … and she hadn’t seen their hair. She was, shall we say, shocked. I happened to be there so it made a picture.
That’s how I always work. I watch, I wait … and hopefully I see one of these magic moments. If you’re patient then something will usually happen. It’s all about being prepared and seeing clearly. I’m not a setter-upper of photographs. You couldn’t set up an image like this even if you tried. If you had a team of people in there and a crew and an art director and a whole mob of people you’d lose the spontaneity. It’s the finger in the landlady’s mouth that makes the image – she’s looking up at Neal X and his hair and his cowboys T-shirt, which was based on a design by Jim French. Her expression is fantastic. She’s not horrified; she’s smiling and thinking: “What the hell is going on here?”

                    <span>From an allotment shelter built out of old doors to a storage shack turned into a chapel, here are some of the best of our readers’ creations
This is my pandemic project: a garden pub shed, called the Doghouse. It is custom-built from timber with a Firestone rubber roof. Lockdown finally gave me the time to build it and I tried to reuse or recycle materials where I could. The doors and windows were from a friend’s old conservatory. The timber herringbone and boards, plus the back bar shelving, are pallet wood, which I burnished with a chainmail pad, and oiled to give it a nice worn look. I built the bar and canopy from scratch using leftover framing timber. The bench was built from a recycled bed headboard and I used a mattress for the seat. The table and chairs were a local Gumtree find, and the bar memorabilia and pumps were from eBay. I’m probably proudest of the bar. It has the feel and character of a little local pub – we often eat dinner there for a change of scenery. Our two children love it. But we will, of course, still support our local pub whenever we can.

                    <span>This low-budget folk-horror is back in Wheatley’s weird, sly world as Joel Fry and Ellora Torchia get lost in the forest 
Here is a low-budget, low-profile film that scampers through the undergrowth up to a horrible folk-horror epiphany, with undeadpan comedy and a gibbering shroom meltdown, percussively hammered home with strobe lightning flashes and skull-splittingly loud snaps. At one point, we are encircled by a fog, which a frowning scientist describes as a “suspension of mushroom spores and water droplets in the air”. It was one of those rare moments in the cinema when you are glad of a mask. 
This is a return to home territory for its writer-director Ben Wheatley, maybe reminiscent of his 17th-century Leveller freakout A Field in England from 2013, which was about civil war deserters captured by an alchemist and finding the world turned upside down. And there are admittedly some familiar tropes: forests where mobile phone signals are impossible, a local myth represented in ancient woodcuts. But for me In the Earth is a return to form, after Wheatley’s interesting but basically uncertain dabble last year in period romantic drama for Netflix with a new version of Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca with Armie Hammer and Lily James. In the Earth brings us back to Wheatley’s classic world of occult loopy weirdness and cult Britmovie seediness, with a new topical dimension of pandemic paranoia, and what keeps you watching is its unreadable, almost undetectable thread of black comedy.

Very little ammunition is required for a culture war these days, so long as your troops are primed to mobilise at the drop of a blog. Julie Tremaine and Katie Dowd, two writers for the online newspaper SFGate, discovered this last month. Their review of the revamped Snow White ride at Disneyland was generally positive, but queried a new scene showing the prince giving Snow White the all-important “true love’s kiss”. 
“A kiss he gives to her without her consent, while she’s asleep, which cannot possibly be true love if only one person knows it’s happening,” they wrote. “It’s hard to understand why the Disneylan…</span>

In the streets of the West Yorkshire constituency of Batley and Spen, voters are uttering phrases that have in the past chilled the bones of Labour canvassers in the party’s fallen heartlands of Scotland and the so-called red wall. “Labour have abandoned us,” say some; “we are going to teach them a lesson,” say others. They are disproportionately – but not exclusively – Muslims in a constituency in which a fifth of voters are of Asian heritage, and their disillusionment has an angry edge.
Ahead of the byelection on 1 July, the Labour hierarchy appears to be stuck in the patterns of remote complacency that we have seen before. The mistakes that saw its historic loss of Hartlepool in the May bylection, and the collapse of core parts of its support over the course of a generation, risk being repeated again.

                    <span>This year’s online-only E3 video game expo was hardly the usual explosion of blockbuster games, but there were still some standout stories 
We all wanted to see Metroid Prime 4, the long-anticipated first-person science-fiction shooter-adventure that has been in development at Nintendo for an absolute age. But instead we got a whole new Metroid – a 2D one in the vein of the SNES and Game Boy Advance classics, the first game in the series in this style for about 19 years. Metroid Dread features Samus Aran being chased by distressing, transforming drone-robots who appear to be largely impervious to her ever-expanding array of weapons, and it looks genuinely scary. It’ll be out on 8 October on Nintendo Switch.

                    <span>The world-class British jazz scene was hit hard by the pandemic. As live shows and in-person collaboration resume, Steam Down, Soweto Kinch and more discuss the future
Music moves differently depending on the space it’s played in. A typical pre-Covid Wednesday evening at the Matchstick Piehouse in London would see its arch space filled with writhing bodies as the jazz collective Steam Down spilled off the stage, their music in dialogue with our yelps, claps and calls to the band.
But on a humid night in May, during the first week of socially distanced indoor performances beginning again, the music took a different route. Playing two Steam Down sessions to a 30-person, seated and masked audience, the seven-person band launched into an extended riff on Nas’s The World Is Yours and bandleader Ahnansé’s liquid tenor solo bounced off the walls while a train rumbled overhead. Steam Down’s music loudly reverberated around us as we danced in our seats, feet vigorously tapping to the beat.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Since the miracle invention of a vaccination for Covid-19, a second discovery has been made: male politicians absolutely love taking their shirts off for a photo opportunity. In the UK, you are more likely to find a Conservative MP bare-chested than a Labour one – Brendan Clarke-Smith and Johnny Mercer are the poster boys of the movement, resplendent in chest hair as they pose for the cameras.
Internationally, there are subtle variations: French ministers like to drape or hold their spare sleeve over their exposed nipple, while proudly exposing tremendous biceps and noble shoulders. Their finance minister, Olivier Véran, in particular, looks as if he’s been caught unawares straight from the shower by a hot delivery driver at the start of an 1980s porn film.

The Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has been defended by one of her predecessors after an independent inquiry censured her personally for obstruction and found Scotland Yard to be “institutionally corrupt”.
Ian Blair, who served as commissioner from 2005 to 2008, criticised the findings of an independent panel inquiring into the unsolved 1987 murder of Daniel Morgan.

Six climate activists and two environmental NGOs have taken Norway to the European court of human rights (ECHR), arguing the Nordic country’s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic are harming young people’s futures.
The activists, Greenpeace and Young Friends of the Earth, want the court to rule that Oslo’s 2016 decision to grant 10 Barents Sea oil exploration licences violated article 112 of Norway’s constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment.

A Greenpeace protester who parachuted into the stadium before Germany’s Euro 2020 match against France in Munich was lucky not to have been shot down by anti-terror marksmen enforcing a no-fly zone, a state minister has said.
Two people were injured when the activist lost control of his powered paraglider, which had a motor attached to his back, and hit overhead camera wires attached to the stadium roof. Fans ducked as he careered towards the spectator area, narrowly missing the stands and demolishing technical equipment before crashing in front of the German penalty area.

Amazon has blamed social media companies for its failure to remove fake reviews from its website, arguing that “bad actors” turn to social networks to buy and sell fake product reviews outside the reach of its own technology.
The company says it removed more than 200m suspected fake reviews before they were seen by customers in 2020 alone, but nonetheless has faced continued criticism for the enormous scale of fake and misleading reviews that make it on to its store.

                    <span>The singer-songwriter talks about his relative William Faulkner, his violent childhood and drugs – and saves a surprise until the end
If you’re after cheery crowdpleasers, John Murry is not your man. Murry is 41, barely known, and has never come close to denting the charts. Yet he has been compared to the great existential pop poets Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen and Scott Walker. And with good reason – he has a rich baritone, writes gorgeous ballads and is half in love with death. The titles of his first two albums, The Graceless Age and A Short History of Decay, reflect the melancholy at the heart of his work. The title of his third, The Stars Are God’s Bullet Holes, is equally bleak. Yet, it turns out that Murry has a surprise in store.
The singer-songwriter is related to the Nobel-prize winning American novelist William Faulkner. Like Faulkner, he paddles along his stream of consciousness – sometimes ferociously. You get a sense of what his songs are about, but seldom know for sure. Take the new album’s opener, Oscar Wilde (Came Here to Make Fun of You). We get the references to terrorist attacks and the images of foreboding, but the meaning is left to us.

                    <span>There are so many variations on South America’s favourite patties, who’s to say which is the best? But that won’t stop our resident perfectionist from giving it her best shot ...
Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz claimed that one could write a small book on empanadas, empanaditas, pasteles, pastelitos, empadinhas and pastèzinhos … namely, “those delicious turnovers, patties and pies, stuffed with meat, poultry, fish, shellfish and other mixtures, and baked or fried, which are so popular throughout Latin America”. Such is the variety on offer, in fact, I’d suggest it would probably be quite a large book. As writer Naomi Tomky notes, perhaps a little wistfully, on Serious Eats, “it would take a lifetime of non-stop empanada-eating to try all of the infinite combinations of doughs, fillings and cooking methods that are so closely tied to the specific culture, flora and fauna in each region of Latin America”.
That’s a challenge I’d happily take on, but the Guardian has refused to extend my deadline, so I’ve chosen to concentrate on the simple, cheese-stuffed sort found almost everywhere. Even then, the range is such from country to country that (as ever) the below should be seen more as an introductory guide than a definitive recipe. Portable, cheap and infinitely versatile, easy to make vegan, gluten-free and even (relatively) healthy, empanadas are surely the ultimate democratic party food. Well … after crisps, anyway.

Inflation is on the march. After the easing of lockdown in May, Britain has raced from economic bust to boom, with the rate of consumer price inflation hitting 2.1% – above expectations and breaching the Bank of England’s 2% target rate.
Driven by the rising cost of petrol, clothing and recreation in the month indoor hospitality reopened, the latest snapshot will fuel concern that the cost of living is spiralling out of control. But it must also be taken with a pinch of salt.

In an interview last month with Oprah for their jointly produced docuseries about mental health, The Me You Can’t See, Prince Harry made a deeply personal disclosure. Harry said he sought a special therapy program, EMDR, to process the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. He described how living with the trauma of her death makes him feel “helpless”, “hunted”, and as if “there is no escape”.
Before I was officially diagnosed with PTSD, painful childhood memories consumed my daily life, sometimes rendering me incapable of completing daily tasks. My PTSD was caused by a tumultuous childhood in a home with an alcoholic father and a rage-filled mother who lashed out at everything around her, including her children.

When I bivvy I’m not in search of sleep. I know I’ll wake up frequently, feeling restricted by my sleeping bag. Bivvying is camping at its simplest: sleeping outside without a tent and minimal gear.
It isn’t about a comfortable night’s rest. It’s about squeezing an adventure into a humdrum week; it’s about being in nature, hearing hedgehogs snuffling and waking to the dawn chorus. It’s a short, sharp dose of escapism that has become even more restorative in the past 15 months. And, while I’ve bivvyed on Dartmoor, on Scotland’s west coast and in places in-between, most of the time I’ve been within 10 miles of my home in Bournemouth.

                    <span>As Pakistan’s supreme court backs bulldozing of homes blamed for floods, critics say government has no proper plans for residents
Maqsooda Bibi, 62, did not know the house she had lived in all her life would be demolished, forcing her whole family to become homeless. But on Monday, Pakistan’s supreme court backed the Sindh government in bulldozing her home and hundreds of others, legalising the eviction of thousands who live along narrow waterways – nullahs – that crisscross Karachi. 
The verdict came as Bibi and hundreds of others held a protest outside the court. “We hoped that the court would ask the government not to make us homeless, but it did the opposite. Our children also protested on Sunday and urged the supreme court to stop demolition. It seems no one here cares for the future of the poor.”

Mitchell and Webb returned after a four-year wait with a second helping of Simon Blackwell’s cuckoo-in-the-nest comedy. And the duo’s talent for red herrings and all-out Peep Show-style ridiculousness meant it somehow outdid the ace first outing.
What we said: “In setting and ambience, Back is as drearily British as Brexit, but its dense dialogue – roughly every third word is hilarious – ensures it is also kin to glossy American cousins such as Succession (written by Blackwell’s old collaborator Jesse Armstrong) and Veep (on which Blackwell has writer and executive producer credits), all of which can be traced back to a common ancestor in Armando Iannucci’s The Thick of It. It is only Back’s characters that are parochial; everything else about this show is world class.” Read the full review

If investing in family-friendly policies is good for business, then many companies are missing a trick. Giving parents and families adequate time, resources and services to care for children, while staying in their jobs and improving their skills and productivity, pays off according to employers. But for many, in all parts of the world, paid parental leave and childcare are not a reality. And that can compromise the first critical years of life – a time when the combination of the right nourishment, environment and love can strengthen a developing brain and give a baby the best start.
Evidence suggests family-friendly policies pay off in healthier, better-educated children and greater gender equality, and are linked to better productivity and the ability to attract and retain workers. Momentum for change is growing with an increasing number of businesses beginning to see the value.

“I had to kill 140,000 hens. I lost 500,000 eggs, 40 tonnes of feed and soon I’m going to give up 250 tonnes of cereals I was going to use to make feed,” says Lewandowski about measures to eliminate a bird flu outbreak on his farm.

The UK government is failing to protect people from the fast-rising risks of the climate crisis, from deadly heatwaves to power blackouts, its official climate advisers have warned.
The climate change committee said action to improve the nation’s resilience is not keeping pace with the impacts of global heating, many of which are already causing harm. The CCC’s experts said they were frustrated by the “absolutely illogical” lack of sufficient action on adaptation, particularly as acting is up to 10 times more cost-effective than not doing so.

Podcast: Inside the world of wildlife trafficking

An unusual rewilding mission is under way just off the M5 motorway. Eels the length of a little finger have finished their 6,600km (4,000-mile) migration from the salty Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic to the brackish water of the Bristol Channel. They have spent two years floating on ocean currents and are hoping to settle in the Somerset Levels. It is one of the planet’s most mysterious wildlife migrations.
Three fishers wait for eels on the banks of the River Parrett outside Burrowbridge with a large square net at the ready. The new arrivals look like threads of glass, fizzing with energy. I let out an involuntary squeal as the first batch arrive, much to the mirth of the fishers. “That’s rubbish! You haven’t been doing this long enough if you’re getting excited about catching 10 [eels] at this time of year,” says Steve George, who is a fencer by trade.

Devi, 51, shares the shed with a cow and two cats, and this has taken its toll. Herbal concoctions have not worked and the visit to a pharmacist in the nearest town, in the Nijmola valley in the Himalayas, which took an entire day, did not help.

I had never seen so many people before in my life. On 9 June 2019, hundreds of thousands of people dressed in white marched slowly but steadily across Hong Kong island.
The heat and humidity were almost unbearable, but protesters from all walks of life came prepared with neck towels, folding fans, and umbrellas to shield the sun. It’s never easy to capture the scale of a crowd, but the intense, palpable energy emanating from the masses of people who had united for common values isn’t something a photograph could ever convey.

                    <span>Israel has a new coalition government made up of eight very different parties. But having ousted Benjamin Netanyahu, can it hold together?
Israel’s longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, was ousted from office on Sunday by a coalition of rival parties from across the political spectrum. Yair Lapid, a centrist former TV news anchor, won a confidence vote in parliament by 60 to 59 seats giving the new coalition a razor-thin majority.
The Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Oliver Holmes, tells Rachel Humphreys that Netanyahu’s downfall was marked by jubilant celebrations from his political opponents. But the new coalition of eight parties is far from stable. Dahlia Scheindlin tells Rachel that despite the momentous week in Israeli politics it may not produce a significant change of course on the biggest issues facing the country. And it may not be the last act for Netanyahu in Israeli politics.

                    <span>We’d like to hear how British farmers feel about the information that has so far emerged about the new trade agreement, and how they believe it might impact them
The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has called for more information about protections for UK farmers in a new trade deal with Australia, amid fears the UK might face a potential flood of cheaper meat, and concerns about a lack of detail on animal welfare and environmental safeguards.
The British government said UK food standards would not be relaxed, but has so far not provided details on areas such as higher levels of antibiotics used in Australian meat.

                    <span>A demonstration against tax rises has morphed into a mass movement against the government, says Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá
An attempt by the Colombian government to introduce sweeping tax changes in response to the coronavirus crisis was met earlier this year by angry protests. Thousands of people flooded on to the streets throughout the country for four consecutive days. It was enough to prompt President Iván Duque to withdraw his tax plans, but by then it was too late to stop the protests. 
Ever since, more and more Colombians have been coming out to protest. Joe Parkin Daniels, who has been reporting on the demonstrations for the Guardian for weeks, tells Rachel Humphreys that they now encompass people from all sections of Colombian society, with a multitude of causes. One thing ever present is a fury at the growing inequality that has been exacerbated by the Covid crisis. As police have cracked down hard on the protesters, more than 50 people have died, with no end to the protests in sight.

At the beginning of 2020 the author Lawrence Wright published a novel in which he imagined a deadly virus outbreak that swept the globe. He couldn’t have predicted that as that book hit the shops real life was eerily mimicking his plot. As a reporter for the New Yorker, Wright had been reporting on pandemics for decades and was ideally placed to chart the spread of Covid-19. 
He tells Anushka Asthana that what unfolded was to become America’s deadliest year, with half a million people lost to the virus. Inside the White House, there were experts desperately trying to influence the president to change course on key decisions. But the story of the initial Covid response, argues Wright, was one of a significant political failure.

Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.
