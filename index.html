Celebrity merchandise has entered a new era of personalisation with pop and reality TV stars selling the shirts off their backs, in a move to adapt to Gen Z consumers who are buying their clothes second hand online.
Singer Olivia Rodrigo who is currently top of the singles and album charts announced the SOURshop, a microsite on resale site Depop. The store features many now sold out clothes that Rodrigo wore in her music videos for her singles Driver’s Licence, Good 4 U and Deja Vu, including silk scarves, creeper platform boots and romper suits. When Etsy bought the resale site last month CEO Josh Silverman called it “the resale home for Gen Z consumers”, pointing out that 90% of its consumers are under 26. It’s a demographic that dovetails with 18-year-old Rodrigo’s fanbase, who rose to fame via TikTok.

As Britain raises anchor from Europe and sets sail into the choppy waters of independence full of bravado, booze and bad dentistry, forcing workers protections off the plank and eager to steal other countries’ stuff, it’s fitting that G7 leaders will be entertained on the beach with sea shanties from local shantymen Du Hag Owr during their Cornwall summit this week. Shanties are, after all, the perfect soundtrack to Brexit: brash, reckless and misty-eyed for the 1850s.
Our esteemed visitors might already be aware of this bawdy folk work song tradition used to synchronise labour on merchant ships as far back as the 15th century, particularly if they represent a country that was colonised to the strains of Blow the Man Down. During their 19th century heyday, a spritely young Joe Biden might even have sung some while mopping down the deck of a tall-sailed clipper.

G7 summit: latest news and reaction

Boris Johnson has told his fellow G7 leaders in Cornwall they should avoid repeating the mistakes of 2008, when the recovery from the deep recession that followed the financial crisis entrenched inequalities.
In his opening remarks to the first formal session of the three-day summit, Johnson said: “It is vital that we don’t repeat the mistakes of the last great crisis, the last big economic recession of 2008, when the recovery was not uniform across all part of society.”

Gareth Southgate has no intention of picking a “fantasy football” line-up at Euro 2020 and is preparing to omit a couple of fan favourites in Sunday’s opening game against Croatia.
The manager is leaning towards using 4-3-3 at Wembley, with Raheem Sterling set to start despite indifferent form for Manchester City in recent months. Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford face a fight to make the XI, with Southgate prioritising the balance of his selection.

The Republican Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has announced that the state will build a wall along its southern border with Mexico, sparking criticism from human rights and immigration advocacy groups.
Citing the Biden administration’s rollback of Trump-era immigration policies, Abbott announced the border wall plans amid other security measures including plans for Texas to construct its own detention centers and $1bn of the state’s budget being allocated to border security. Abbott also declared that more undocumented immigrants will be arrested and sent to local jails versus being turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as Ice.

                    <span>Euro 2020 is finally under way, and Italy are back, and nature is healing. On a taut and muggy night in Rome, a crowd of 16,000 were treated to a vivid display of smart, patient attacking football: a statement performance that instantly marks Roberto Mancini’s side out as one of the favourites for the tournament. And yet perhaps the symbolism of the occasion was greater still. Three decades after Italy last hosted a major tournament, five years after they last competed in one, 15 months after this fixture was postponed in the most disorienting and dreadful of circumstances, this felt like a sort of rebirth: a celebration of sport and congregation and the importance of savouring every last moment.
From the first whistle Italy set about the much-fancied Turks with a restless, percussive impatience. Their press was smart and well-organised, their movement on and off the ball exquisite. And yet after a frustrating goalless first half you wondered if the weight of expectation might just get to them. Instead, with an emotional maturity that has not always been the hallmark of Italian teams past, they plundered three unanswered goals, building an irresistible momentum that Turkey were powerless to arrest. “The crowd helped us,” Mancini admitted afterwards. “It was crucial for us to move the ball quickly.”

The first thing I notice when I meet Maeva Heim is her healthy mane. I’m immediately envious. She’s styled her hair in a simple yet chic semi up-do, with a few curls framing her face – like an afro hair version of a messy bun. It’s a flawlessly imperfect look that I’ve tried to recreate with my own afro textured hair in the past, with little luck. She’ll later describe it as “lazy girl hair”.
These words have not always been synonymous with Black hair, generally because of how much time it takes to style. “I’m all about doing as little as possible,” she tells me. “To embrace this lazy girl hair lifestyle, you can’t ascribe to that ideal; that super glossy, perfectly curled curl.”

England unhappy with signal given by Richard Illingworth

Does international cricket need the soft signal for low catches? It was a question posed by many, including England’s bowling coach, Jon Lewis, as New Zealand moved to a position of strength on the second day of the second Test at Edgbaston.
The tourists closed on 229 for three, trailing by 74 runs, thanks in part to Devon Conway following the imperious double century made on debut at Lord’s last week with another well-crafted 80 that underlined the left-hander’s class.

The lifting of all lockdown restrictions in England is likely to be delayed for up to a month from the planned date of 21 June, government sources have told the Guardian.
It comes as coronavirus cases in England are rising at their fastest rate since the winter wave.

Darnella Frazier was 17 at the time when she encountered Floyd, who was Black, being crushed to death on the ground by white police officer Derek Chauvin, who was kneeling on the man’s neck during an arrest in May last year.

                    <span>Where other bowlers have seen careers ruined by injury and off-field issues, Anderson is still going strong in his 162nd Test
“What’s the secret?” Nasser Hussain asked Jimmy Anderson before the start of this Test. “A lot of it is luck,” Anderson told him. “I’ve been born with a body that can cope with the pressures of bowling.” The rest, he said, was “hunger”, the appetite to work at getting better every day for the past 6,596 days, since he made his Test debut in May 2003. In that time he’s played 162 games, which puts him top of the list, one ahead of his great mate Alastair Cook. Luck and hunger. It’s a short reply to a question that, judging by the long list of fast bowlers England have picked in Test cricket in the past 17 years, has a lot of answers.
That first summer, 2003, England also gave a debut to Richard Johnson, who took 16 wickets in three Tests before his career was ruined by a persistent knee injury. And another to James Kirtley, who won man of the match in his first game, before he was forced to remodel his action after he was accused of chucking. And Kabir Ali, who was reckoned to be one of the brighter prospects in county cricket. He got to play one solitary Test at Headingley and took five wickets in it, too, but was dropped because of what Wisden described “as mutterings about his girth” and his parallel career as a male model.

Biden previously met the Queen in 1982 when he was the Democratic senator for Delaware but this will be their first rendezvous since Biden beat Donald Trump to win the White House.

Holidaymakers ate fish and chips and drank pints as thousands of eco protesters marched past the harbour-side restaurants, banging drums, blowing whistles, chanting and singing.
A group of teenagers took selfies in front of a burly Royal Navy bomb disposal expert while a character dressed as Batman with the sign: “Give peace a chance” pinned to his back cycled past.

Adam Gilchrist’s autobiography True Colours: My Story is one of the great “unreliable narrator” sports books. Not because there’s a single false note in its 500 pages of tearful, heartfelt authenticity, but because it’s not really His Story but is instead a meditation on his own obsession with certain concepts – Australianism, Baggy Greenism, Good Blokeism, and above all the good health, the sacred vibes of the Aussie Test team.
Changes of personnel are agonised over. Gilchrist worries endlessly about morale. There are 34 entries in the index under the heading “Team Feeling”. In the Gilchrist universe Test cricket, teamship and the teamship of Test cricket are sacred, ineffable things, to be preserved at all costs, seals unbroken.

Thousands of artists who signed to Sony Music Entertainment before the year 2000 and did not recoup their advances will be eligible to profit from their recordings for the first time, under a new initiative proposed by the major label.
While Sony is not explicitly wiping artist debt, in order to account for any act who has reversion rights tied to recoupment, reports Music Business Worldwide, it has said it will pay royalties on sales and streaming to any act that has not received such payments since 2000, backdated to 1 January 2021.

                    <span>Joe Biden sees an increasingly dangerous world which in some ways resembles the 1930s. He’s right to update the way democracies cooperate
Before the second world war, states acted as they wished in international affairs, limited only by their resources and power. These circumstances began to change in August 1941, before America joined the allied cause. On a battleship off the coast of Newfoundland, the US president Franklin Roosevelt and the British prime minister Winston Churchill issued the Atlantic charter at a time when Nazi Germany appeared to be decisively winning the European war. A few months later, America, Britain, the Soviet Union and 23 other governments declared in the name of “United Nations” an intention to regulate the postwar world based on three revolutionary principles: free trade, non-aggression and democracy.
Eighty years later, Joe Biden and Boris Johnson have signed a new Atlantic charter, to reflect a world of different threats and one in which the UK is a much diminished power. Mr Biden looks out and sees an increasingly dangerous world. In some ways the vista resembles the 1930s – with populists, nationalists and demagogues on the rise, European powers divided, and democracy vulnerable to foreign manipulation. There’s no mention of China in the 604-word charter, but it is the undeclared target of many of the policies regarding debt transparency, freedom of navigation and protecting the west’s “innovative edge”.

                    <span>Treating the most vulnerable young people as a money-making opportunity is wrong. The care review must lead to change
It is impossible, even for an appointee regarded by critics as too close to government and with overly restricted terms of reference, to look at children’s homes without being appalled by what is going on. That is the conclusion to be drawn from remarks this week by Josh MacAlister, who is several months into a long-awaited review of children’s social care. He warned that the sector is broken and that operators must cut “indefensible” levels of profit and improve young people’s experiences.
Recent years have seen numerous reports and complaints by official bodies about a dysfunctional system, in which councils on the verge of bankruptcy pay ever increasing prices (up 40% since 2013, to about £200,000 a year per child) while profits soar. Private companies are making an estimated £250m profit annually out of 16,000 children who live in children’s homes in England, Wales and Scotland (a much larger number of children, around 65,000, live in foster care).

Peru was on a knife-edge on Friday as its electoral board reviewed ballots cast in the presidential election, after a challenge to the tally by the losing candidate Keiko Fujimori.
The final tally gave the leftist teacher Pedro Castillo a razor-thin 50.17% to 49.83% advantage over his rightwing rival Fujimori, which amounts to about 60,000 votes.

Labour’s analysis of declarations released by the Electoral Commission show the firms gave £891,984 to Tory central office and eight local associations – a sizeable chunk of the £6,418,295 the party reported receiving in the first three months of 2021.

When Tom Davies and his stepbrother, Greg, were growing up on the edge of Aldridge, a town in the West Midlands, they would pick a point in the distance, a TV mast for instance, and make their way straight there, even if it meant clambering through quarries, sneaking across railway tracks and running away from angry farmers.
Now Davies has channelled this childhood taste for adventure into a YouTube series following his attempts to traverse entire countries in a direct line, based on GPS tracking.
The scrapes he finds himself in along the way, from almost drowning in swollen rivers and slashing his hand on barbed wire in Wales to a run-in with the police in Scotland, combined with his laid-back humour (he describes Norway as “Wales on steroids”), have garnered him a huge fanbase, with 925,000 subscribers to his channel.
Videos documenting his most recent “straight line mission” across Scotland are currently racking up hundreds of thousands of views, with the next episode set to go live on Sunday – and each one could be his last as obstacles threaten to cut short his journey..

Amalia, the eldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, who on Thursday passed her school-leaving exams with distinction – and flew her school rucksack from the palace flagpole to celebrate – said in a handwritten letter to Mark Rutte that she did not want to take up her allowance until she had proper royal duties.

                    <span>The US president believes in global cooperation. Britain’s prime minister has always pushed in the opposite direction 
Optics, meet reality. The visuals emanating from Cornwall are just what Boris Johnson wanted: a warm encounter with the new US president, followed by a summit of world leaders with himself in the chair. The “special relationship” renewed, “Global Britain” in action, him at the centre: job done. Trouble is, the photo-ops and reality don’t match.
I’m not referring to the gulf that separates the personal styles of Joe Biden and the British prime minister. One former diplomat with experience of both men notes that, while Biden “asks for briefing folders and does his homework, Boris’s instinct is to wing it and play the clown”.

A co-founder of the Scottish craft beer firm BrewDog has apologised to more than 60 former members of staff after they complained of a “toxic” working environment in an open letter that has fuelled concern among the company’s army of small shareholders.
In an Instagram post, Martin Dickie wrote: “I would like to wholeheartedly apologise to every single person who has put their name on that list.”

Another verdict goes against the government (Covid contract for firm run by Cummings’ friends unlawful, finds judge, 9 June). Amid much discussion of the Good Law Project’s activities, however, one question goes unanswered: given that democracies need a lively independent scrutiny of government, what is the sanction?
The government reacts, as we have now come to expect, with lies and threats. The GLP itself is the target of accusations that it is “misusing crowdfunding”, and the government uses taxpayers’ money to run up huge costs, which the GLP is at risk of having to pay. The court is under the threat of legislation to curb the use of judicial review.

As much of the EU prepares to open up to tourists who are vaccinated, have recovered from the coronavirus or can provide a negative test from 1 July, the Dutch capital’s city hall said in a statement it was taking “extra measures” to discourage excesses.

World leaders are meeting this weekend a few miles from my home in Penzance, Cornwall, in what could be our best and last chance to reverse the UK’s destructive aid cuts that followed the Foreign Office takeover of the Department for International Development last year.
Up to March of this year, I was proud to work for DfID, having spent many years supporting health systems and confronting disease in some of the most challenging settings in the world. Most recently, I was senior health adviser in Malawi, one of the world’s poorest countries, where our support was vital to confronting Covid-19 and ensuring women can access reproductive health services. The shameful and heartbreaking prospect of having to dismantle this vital support led me to resign and seek more worthwhile employment elsewhere.

                    <span>Reynolds returns as bodyguard Michael Bryce, with Samuel L Jackson as an assassin, Salma Hayek as his badass wife and Antonio Banderas as a Greek supervillain. Please stop
Here’s the tiresome follow-up to the tiresome action comedy with the tiresomely (and unfunnily) muddled premise: bodyguards generally protect people against hitmen and hitmen generally don’t need bodyguards as they’re not publicly visible … but that wasn’t the point. Anyway, here’s the sequel with the extra-clumsy double-possessive in the title.
Ryan Reynolds is back as Michael Bryce, the former triple-A rated bodyguard, now haunted and traumatised by his professional failures, and by his association with the notorious assassin Darius Kincaid, played by Samuel L Jackson. Michael is stripped of his “licence” to practise bodyguarding and is now in therapy; but just as he decides to take a restorative European break by the pool, Michael gets sucked right back into the melee by Kincaid’s badass wife Sonia, in which role Salma Hayek is once again phoning in her hellcat routine. So the wacky trio are back together again, Reynolds getting whatever laugh lines there are going, as he is bemused and depressed by the situation that this couple have put him in, though not as bemused and depressed as all of us in the audience.

Advertising and sales revenues at the Sun and the Sun on Sunday plummeted, with turnover falling by 23% from £419.9m to £324m in the year to the end of June 2020.

New York, 1986: artists Gretchen Bender and Cindy Sherman record a conversation. Bender had just edited the video for Megadeth’s Peace Sells and Sherman asks about videos she’s making with manipulated television footage – does she want to change TV itself? “I think of the media as a cannibalistic river,” Bender replies, describing a rapid flow that picks up, appropriates and repackages everything in its path. “There is no consciousness or mind. It’s about absorbing and converting.”
The following year Bender showed Total Recall – 24 stacked TVs and three projection screens, broadcasting choreographed video edited at a pulse-raising pace. The mash-up of ads, war footage, idents, movie clips and abstract animation is set to an intense electronic score. Total Recall broadcasts the acceleration of contemporary life, an attention-deficit TV culture of rolling news and channel surfing.

Aung San Suu Kyi, who previously spent a total of 15 years in detention at the behest of Myanmar’s generals and is widely revered domestically as a symbol of the country’s yearning for democracy, is expected to appear in court in Naypyidaw on Monday.

“The government believes that it is always legitimate to examine and debate Britain’s history, but that removing statues, artwork and other historical objects is not the right approach,” Oliver Dowden wrote to the board last summer. “As a government-funded organisation, I would expect you to be mindful of the above approach.”

The investigation, originally announced in January 2020, will proceed after an Indian court on Friday dismissed pleas by Amazon and its rival – the Walmart-owned Flipkart – to quash its investigation into the business practices of the huge US retailers.

A government body has recommended the removal of limits inherited from the EU on about half of the UK’s steel imports, in a move that provoked fury from British producers.
The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) said on Friday that it would revoke the limits on nine categories of steel product, including some bars and wires, meaning imports will no longer face steep tariffs after quotas are filled. It extended limits for three years on another 10 products, including some steel for railways, gas pipes and large sheets.

The pandemic has deepened the long-running crisis in global education. Many children around the world missed the majority of the last academic year. At the height of school closures, 1.6 billion children and young people were out of education.
Girls have been among the hardest hit. When they are not enrolled in school they are more likely to be forced into child marriage, subjected to female genital mutilation and exposed to gender-based violence. There is a real risk of a lost generation of girls, with 20 million likely to never return to school. So we must act.

                    <span>This simple but effective forearm plank – done properly – will counteract stiffness and pain caused by sitting down all day
This strengthens the core muscles involved in “anti-extension” – ie, any movement that resists extending the lower back – which applies to anyone who works at a desk. It uses all your abdominal muscles, but also works the legs, glutes (your bum) and shoulders. The key is to keep your hips in line with the rest of your body. Don’t let them fall towards the floor or stick up towards the ceiling: easier said than done. 
a) Starting from a kneeling position, come into a forearm plank position; bend your elbows so they are parallel with the floor, and turn your palms flat against it.

                    <span>Solar Power delivers a statement of loose-limbed maturity from a mercurial star who is much imitated but utterly unique
Lorde has said she was “waiting for the right moment” to release her comeback single, Solar Power, and opted for 11 June to coincide with the year’s only solar eclipse (although leaks may have forced her hand). Her chosen date resonates beyond the obvious thematic associations of her hazy, sun-worshipping comeback single and its cheeky cover art.
Pop stars, especially young women, are expected to be available, relatable, always on. Lorde has defied this with an old-school release rate (just three albums in nine years) and such a low-key public presence that a recent update of her Instagram account on which she reviews onions rings generated headlines. (She benefits, too, from New Zealand’s minimal paparazzi culture.) The rare arrival of new music from the 24-year-old, last heard from in 2017, has come to feel like its own celestial event.

“Disloyal employees” at Italy’s public broadcaster, Rai, are suspects in the theft of dozens of works of art from its offices thought to date back to the 1970s.
In what the daily newspaper Il Messaggero has described as “the sack of Rai”, the “priceless” artworks were removed from the broadcaster’s headquarters in Rome and units across the country and replaced with fakes. The works included original paintings by Renato Guttuso and etchings by Claude Monet and Amedeo Modigliani.

This year’s is being held in Carbis Bay, Cornwall. Very rarely are things achieved at these summits. The best thing about them is the opportunity to laugh at the photographs, which somehow are even more excruciating than the usual political photo ops.

In 2019, the most recent iteration of the Every Woman Biennial drew 3,000 attendees to two galleries in New York and Los Angeles. Among the 600 artists represented were a 12-year-old trans photographer of moths and butterflies and a 91-year-old multimedia artist who makes paper assemblages.
“That was ultimately the show of my dreams,” says C Finley, who founded the world’s largest biennial of women and non-binary artists. She is confident about the forthcoming inaugural London leg: “This show is the thirst trap of London – it will scratch an itch people didn’t even know they had.”

It’s famously impossible to take a bathroom break during a rocket launch, meaning Jeff Bezos will soon experience what it’s like to be one of his warehouse workers. Or, as the Amazon boss put it last week: “To see the Earth from space … changes your relationship with humanity.” That’s hugely encouraging. I feel like we’re just one successful interstellar wormhole mission to a distant galaxy away from allowing employees to unionise.

‘Johnson didn’t have the courage to stand by the England team’

Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of a lack of courage over his reluctance to condemn fans who boo England’s players for taking the knee and has told the prime minister that his “failure of leadership” undermined the team’s chances of success at Euro 2020.
The Labour leader, who believes that Gareth Southgate has shown Johnson how to be a leader, said no football supporter should boo their team and argued that backing the players in their fight against racism and discrimination should not be a difficult choice for those in positions of political power.

Our child is of primary-school age, and my only priority is to ensure his safety. I explained to my husband that our son and I would no longer be meeting my brother-in-law. (I have never liked the man; in the past, he has threatened violence against his own teenage children.)

Nightclubs and bars could sue the government to prevent a delay to Covid-19 restrictions being lifted on 21 June in England, amid mounting fears that struggling venues will go to the wall if they have to stay closed any longer.
The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) is understood to be weighing up legal action on behalf of venues such as nightclubs that have spent money to be ready to welcome guests after a year of enforced closure.

Ismail Abedi, the brother of Salman Abedi, who detonated the bomb, and their younger brother Hashem, who was jailed for participating in the plot, wanted a promise from the attorney general that if he were to give evidence his answers would not “land him in the dock”, his solicitor, Jeremy Hawthorn, told the hearing in Manchester last month.

When the gunfire starts it is like a thunderclap, the monks and nuns explain, and the sound reverberates up the valley. During the game shooting season, it is not unusual for avian casualties to land within the grounds of Samye Ling, the largest Tibetan Buddhist temple in western Europe. Tame ducks who have sought refuge from the hunters now waddle and strut between the golden statues, and peck at the monastics’ brick red robes.
This secluded spiritual community now finds itself in a confounding position, standing with the local community of Eskdalemuir against the development of shooting ranges that threaten their “pocket of peace”.

In a public intervention that appeared timed to help Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, before a Knesset vote on Sunday that could end his 12 consecutive years in office, the agency’s former head Yossi Cohenrevealed details of operations long attributed to Israel.

It’s very like a mirage, isn’t it, the route out of lockdown? From April’s distance, “freedom day”, 21 June, seemed likely to the point of being inevitable. It was so obviously going to happen that there wasn’t much else to be said, beyond: “Oh ho, that’s convenient, isn’t it, so close to the prime minister’s birthday on 19 June?”
I was planning a housewarming, delayed since November. Mr Z absolutely loves parties – gigantic ones. His ideal scenario is to pack a room so tight that somebody will definitely get set alight – because, in the end, with enough candles and enough bodies, it’s just a numbers game – and the only creature who can move around freely is a cat (which we don’t have), like in Breakfast at Tiffany’s. You can raise any objection – 200 people? Really? What will they all eat? – and his answer is always: “Frazzles.”

When my boyfriend and I moved into our own flat, we were congratulated on our “new chapter”. I didn’t get it: we’d already been living together for several years in a shared place, so the move seemed more like a minor upgrade. It turns out that everyone was being vague about what this chapter actually is. Which is understandable: “Congratulations on opening your new chapter of arguing about what mundane crap you need to buy” is far too long for a card.

Rug underlay, a jigsaw, a storage thing to put another thing in – products with dozens of versions available and thus requiring research to make the “right” choice. I had no idea starting a new chapter with my great love would feel quite so much like a public-sector organisation tendering for a water cooler.

The decision, which was first revealed by the Guardian, came after more than 500 of the 589 local councils and landowners across England gave permission for the restart.

                    <span>It’s avo on toast for everyone thanks to an eye-watering drop in the price of the nation’s favourite brunch fruit
It was the summer of 2018 and Australians were sweating. In their hands: a single avocado pear, barely ripe. The price: $9. Could it possibly be worth it? And how many times had it been squeezed?
Thankfully, though much has gone wrong in the world since that fateful January, one thing has gone right – this winter, Australians can afford to eat all the avo on toast they like, with the savoury green fruit selling for just $1 (55p, or 77c) each.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The US Food and Drug Agency (FDA) has raised significant concerns about the rapid Covid test on which the UK government has based its multibillion-pound mass testing programme.
In a scathing review, the US health agency suggested the performance of the test had not been established, presenting a risk to health, and that the tests should be thrown in the bin or returned to the California-based manufacturer Innova.

Coronavirus – latest updates

More than 90% of Covid cases in the UK are now down to the coronavirus Delta variant first discovered in India, data has revealed, as the total number of confirmed cases passed 42,000.
Also known as B.1.617.2, the Delta variant has been linked to a rise in Covid cases in the UK in the past weeks. It is believed to spread more easily than the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, that was first detected in Kent, and is somewhat more resistant to Covid vaccines, particularly after just one dose. It may be also associated with a greater risk of hospitalisation.

Goldman Sachs has told its staff in the US that they must disclose their Covid-19 vaccination status before a planned return to office working next week.
The investment bank, whose 6,000 UK workers have separately been told they have the option of filling out their status anonymously to give the business an idea of vaccination levels, had previously told US staff that disclosing their inoculation status would be optional.

Good night and good luck to the loyal 30-plus Premiership players hanging up their battered old boots this week. For long-serving professionals such as Matt Banahan at Gloucester, Matt Cox at Worcester, Bath’s Ross Batty and Newcastle’s John Hardie, the slow limp into rugby’s twilight is the simple bit: here’s wishing the departing stalwarts every happiness wherever life takes them next.
The regular season’s conclusion, though, is also a suitable moment to reflect on the chances of their successors enjoying similar longevity. How many more Chris Pennells, for example, will there be in future? A one-club man who made his debut for his local side Worcester in 2007, he has just called time on a 14-year stint at Sixways. With the average Premiership career lasting seven or eight years, such players could soon become rare.

Marc Thompson was 17 when he found out he had HIV. He had been out as gay for only a year when a friend suggested he get himself tested. “I thought: ‘Yeah, why not? I’m not going to be positive.’ You had to wait two weeks for the results back then – I’d actually arranged to have lunch with a friend on the day they were due, because it never occurred to me that I would be positive.”
Thompson says he will never forget how he felt that day – partly because he is still asked about it all the time. As one of the UK’s leading HIV, Aids and queer black men’s health campaigners, sharing his own experience comes with the job. “I felt complete and utter numbness,” he says. “All I could hear was white noise. I was walking around in a daze.”

                    <span>Comfort Eating, our restaurant critic’s new weekly podcast, is a fascinating, funny glimpse behind closed doors. What are the snacks that see her celebrity guests though tough times?
My new Guardian podcast, Comfort Eating, in which I talk to famous folk about their food secrets, is my dream opportunity for an honest chat. Interviewing celebrities is always a bit of a tussle: they arrive semi-spikily, bearing lists of things they don’t want to talk about, or they don’t want to be there at all, or they’ve been a prisoner all day in a hotel suite, repeating dull anecdotes about their latest project.
Many times, the most exhilarating part of any TV interview comes right before the cameras roll. That’s when the audio person asks, “OK, quickly, just tell me what you had for breakfast?” It’s not a real question even; it’s just the time-worn way audio people nudge celebs to make a noise so they can tinker with the sound levels. But it’s the bit I love the most – and the bit when famous people are most off-guard. “Two Creme Eggs … I can never stop at one. They remind me of being a little boy,” one gym-honed British thesp replied. Or, from the mouth of a sylph-like sex symbol: “Ritz biscuits with Primula cheese and Branston pickle. I carry them in my suitcase to keep me sane.”

                    <span>Their 80s hits are now hitting the billion-streams mark, but the duo’s genre-resistant pop often chafed against the zeitgeist. They recall the triumphs – and makeup choices – of the past 50 years
I’m half an hour into my interview with John Oates when he insists I need to look at YouTube as a matter of extreme urgency. “You’ve never seen this?” he says, incredulous, down the phone from his home in Nashville. “My friend, I don’t know you very well, but you’re missing a great moment in music history. Your life will change. Your perceptions of us will never be the same again.”
This is the 1973 video Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates made for She’s Gone, the standout track from their album Abandoned Luncheonette, and a staple of their live sets to this day. It’s certainly striking viewing. The pair are slumped, poker-faced, in armchairs (“That’s the furniture from our apartment,” notes Oates). Daryl Hall is resplendent in a pair of platform sandals; Oates is wearing a bow tie and dress shirt with no sleeves. A woman walks in front of the camera – this, Oates informs me, is the songwriter Sara Allen, Hall’s former partner and the co-author of a string of Hall &amp; Oates hits – followed by a man with a moustache wearing a sparkly devil costume. The latter helps Oates into a penguin suit dinner jacket with an enormous pair of flippers attached to the arms, in which he listlessly mimes a guitar solo. All three march around the armchairs together, then walk off.

Wealthy countries risk an “unforgivable lost opportunity” by not emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic with newly green economies to address the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has warned.
Before meeting the leaders of the world’s major economic powers at the G7 summit in the UK, António Guterres said he was concerned that the richest nations have pumped billions of dollars more into fossil fuels than clean energy since the pandemic, despite their promises of a green recovery.

The rescheduled European football championships kick off in Rome on Friday in what the city’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, has billed as a symbol of a new beginning.
Andrea Bocelli will sing Nessun Dorma before the opening match between Italy and Turkey at the Olympic stadium, and a football village will open at Piazza del Popolo in the centre of Rome.

                    <span>To its critics, it is a British Fox News; to its creators, it is a vital correction to a liberal London-centric media. Can Andrew Neil’s upstart news channel change the face of British broadcasting?
For years, Britain’s rolling news landscape has been dominated by Sky and the BBC. On Sunday, a new rival, GB News, is entering the fray – and although its chairman and most famous face, Andrew Neil, insists that any comparisons to Fox News are idiotic, many see an echo in its plan to use outspoken presenters to discuss the most controversial issues of the day. 
But Neil insists that the plan is not to tack to the right, but to address an audience which he says has been let down by the existing broadcasters – and which he believes is crying out for a channel that addresses its concerns. As the channel’s newly hired team race to be ready for their debut, Anushka Asthana asks the Guardian’s media editor, Jim Waterson, whether GB News is bound to be a participant in the so-called culture war – and whether a British audience really wants to see a radical departure from the more traditional model that dominates today.

                    <span>Many are beginning to fear the world may soon be caught in the crossfire between Beijing and Washington
In July 1971, US national security adviser Henry Kissinger embarked on a secret mission to China, then America’s sworn enemy. This 48-hour ice-breaking trip paved the way for Richard Nixon’s historic handshake with Chairman Mao a year later. Nixon’s visit altered the strategic geometry of the cold war and influenced Washington’s subsequent movement towards détente with Moscow.
Half a century on, as Joe Biden arrived in Cornwall to attend the G7 meeting, there was a looming sense of history in the making again – one that involves the talk of allies (a group of like-minded democracies) and adversaries (notably Russia and China). It is also one that invokes memories of the cold war in the 1970s, when strategists like Kissinger crafted the art of balancing power between major geopolitical players.

Plastic items from takeaway food and drink dominate the litter in the world’s oceans, according to the most comprehensive study to date.
Single-use bags, plastic bottles, food containers and food wrappers are the four most widespread items polluting the seas, making up almost half of the human-made waste, the researchers found. Just 10 plastic products, also including plastic lids and fishing gear, accounted for three-quarters of the litter, due to their widespread use and extremely slow degradation.

                    <span>Omar Abu al-Ouf lost his parents, grandparents and two siblings when his building was bombed by the Israeli military last month, in a street where 43 people were killed. Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>The world’s richest democracies will come together in Britain this week with global heating high on the agenda. Can they match big promises with concrete action? 
The damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic has been huge, but it pales in comparison to the potential risks associated with the climate crisis. With the world coalescing around the importance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the next 10 years are the last chance to meet that goal - and with the Cop26 summit in Glasgow later this year, the G7 summit in Cornwall this week is the next staging post in a crucial six months to settle on a way forward.
But even as many countries set out significant pledges to do their part, the reality of their policies is often far behind. Anushka Asthana speaks to the Guardian’s environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, about what must happen to catch up with those commitments – and what this summit will tell us about the likelihood of making changes that are crucial to averting catastrophe.

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>Two weeks after Dominic Cummings told MPs that the health secretary was a serial liar who lost the trust of No 10, Matt Hancock will face the same committee to defend himself. Heather Stewart explains what is at stake, and what it could mean for the next stage of the pandemic
When Dominic Cummings appeared before MPs to set out his account of what went wrong in the early stages of the Covid pandemic, he attempted a political assassination. But a fortnight later, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is still limping on. So far, Hancock has been able to bat away questions from journalists, and at the dispatch box, without much trouble, and has retained the support of the prime minister. But a grilling by MPs, who will have much more time and the chance to follow up on their questions, will present him with a far greater challenge.
Hancock’s day of reckoning comes with the 21 June planned unlocking still uncertain, and the number of cases rising again, so his future will have profound consequences for the country. Rachel Humphreys spoke to the Guardian’s political editor, Heather Stewart, about the questions he is likely to face, the light his answers could shed on what went wrong, and why Boris Johnson appears determined to stick with his man — for now.
