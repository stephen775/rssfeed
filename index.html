                    <span>Richer neighbourhoods in southern England saved £12 for every £1 saved by those in poorer areas
Britain’s contrasting economic fortunes during Covid are highlighted by a study that shows the £150bn of savings accrued over the pandemic are overwhelmingly concentrated in the affluent south of England, while large parts of the north and the Midlands faced an “avalanche” of personal debt.
Affluent people in richer southern England neighbourhoods were typically able to save £12 for every £1 saved by people in poorer neighbourhoods in mostly northern cities and towns, who spent proportionately more of their income on essentials such as food and energy, said the Centre for Cities thinktank.

It’s been around for 40 years, but the £50 note doesn’t have a great image: there is a perception that aside from some overseas tourists, the only people who use them are criminals, tradespeople looking to evade tax and gamblers.

Researchers have come up with an ingenious way to test the theory that male jumping spiders have evolved colourful stripes to ward off predators – they have put makeup on them.
Unlike the females of the species, the male Habronattus pyrrithrix come in vivid hues to attract mates. But scientists writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science wanted to establish whether their bright, striped backs help protect them from predators.

Channel 4’s four decades as a publicly owned broadcaster could be about to come to an end, with ministers pushing ahead with controversial plans to sell the channel as part of a shake-up that could transform the landscape of British television.
The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, confirmed that he would hold a swift consultation on proposed privatisation, in a move that would mark the end of an era in British broadcasting and would radically alter how one of the UK’s leading public service television networks operates.

It would perhaps be overly generous to say that the Netflix dating caper Good on Paper was itself an embodiment of its title but pre-release there were enough reasons to at least label it “fine on paper”, a welcome addition to the streamer’s growing sub-genre of female-fronted, and created, comedies. First, and what’s often most depressingly appealing these days about a Netflix “original” is that it was produced by an actual studio before being acquired (in this instance, Universal), gracing it with the feel and aesthetic of a genuine movie. Second, it’s based on a true story from comedian Iliza Schlesinger’s life, one that she’s turned into a script, craftily giving herself her first major lead and also telling a dating story from an authentic place, rather than leaning on a married person’s broad strokes idea of what swiping, flirting and shagging is like in the modern age.

The exchange at the UN human rights council on Tuesday marks the latest downturn in relations between Canada and China, which have deteriorated steadily as the two countries clash over human rights, trade and allegations of “hostage diplomacy”.

With 67 minutes gone at Wembley, with the game starting to sag a little and stretch towards its slightly fretful end notes, Jack Grealish could be seen walking slowly, steeped in a sudden fug of melancholy, towards the far touchline. It was a walk with a touch of theatre, a degree of flounce.
It would be wrong to read too much into it. Grealish flounces when he’s happy. He had, earlier, flounced all over the opening 20 minutes of this game, creating the opening goal and, together with the hugely impressive Bukayo Saka, reworking not just the trajectory, but the basic sense of joy and possibilities around this rather gaunt and mannered England team.

A curious thing happened on Tuesday night. England played a European Championship game at Wembley and it was – and I had to look this word up, so apologies if the meaning isn’t quite right – enjoyable. People sang and cheered. The national stadium, so often a theatre of irritations, felt contented and boisterous. England shuffled diffidently – and not without a few grumbles – into the last 16. And on a night when Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire made their return, England’s leader on the field was a 19‑year‑old from west London with five caps to his name.
Electrifying teenage attacker dances his way through a major tournament defence. We all think we’ve seen this film before, and if you listen closely you can probably already hear the weepy BBC montage at its end. But amid the complications and the paradoxes of England’s performance here, the uncertain fates and futures, one fact at least felt clear enough. As “It’s Coming Home” rained down from the stands, the stage belonged to a man born just a 92 bus ride from Wembley. Welcome – belatedly – to the summer of Bukayo Saka.

                    <span>The expansion of the European Championship to 24 teams helped Scotland to return to tournament football after an absence of more than two decades. The format could not, though, assist with the end to another horror run. The Scots have still never emerged from the group phase of a competition. Victory here would have changed that statistic. Instead, comprehensive defeat. Perhaps that will be easier for the Tartan Army to stomach than any kind of glorious, cliched failure.
As inspired by Luka Modric – who else? – Croatia took a hammer to Steve Clarke’s dream. “No one is sure how he still manages to play to the level he still does,” the Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic said of Modric. “I can’t think of the words to describe it.” Join the club.

                    <span>More than anything, it was a night when Gareth Southgate needed his attacking talents to express themselves. Safe passage to the last 16 at Euro 2020 had been guaranteed but could England show something to generate a bit of excitement, to fire the feeling that they might be able to cut through teams – a quality that had been wholly absent last Friday in the 0-0 draw with Scotland? Thanks in large part to Jack Grealish and Bukayo Saka, who both came into the starting lineup for the first time at these finals, they did so during an enjoyable first half when England asked questions of the Czech Republic with their movement and interplay.

It was once known as the filthiest river in England but these days, Bradford Beck is hardly known at all. Much of its seven-mile (11km) route is culverted, meaning its course runs through tunnels constructed beneath the city centre, even passing unnoticed under Bradford city hall.
But its anonymous status might be about to change, after the completion of a restoration project which aims to improve the natural ecology and biodiversity of the beck and surrounding woodland across an urbanised stretch in Shipley.

                    <span>Before the crucial final Group E match against Slovakia, the coach insists his side can find their top form at Euro 2020
If Forrest Gump reckoned life was like a box of chocolates, Luis Enrique says the selección are like a bottle of cava. The former Netherlands international Rafael van der Vaart has called Spain “horrible”, in comments that have provided a surprisingly significant part of the backdrop to their final group game against Slovakia on Wednesday night, but their coach insists there’s something good in there – if only they can find a way to get it out.

The South African opera star Pretty Yende has accused French immigration authorities of “outrageous racial discrimination” after being detained, strip searched and held in a dark room at Paris’ main airport.
“Police brutality is real for someone who looks like me,” Yende, who is black, said in a social media post on Tuesday, a day after the encounter at the Charles de Gaulle airport.

When he took over as Labour leader, with the country in lockdown, Starmer entrusted many of the key jobs in his office to longtime, trusted aides.

Nicaragua’s most prominent journalist has fled the country for a second time after police raided his house during a widening crackdown on opposition figures by the country’s Sandinista rulers.
Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the editor of the Confidencial website and a member of one of the country’s most influential political families, said on Tuesday he had left the Central American country to “safeguard his freedom”.

The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is negotiating with legislators and said the $5.2bn plan would pay landlords all of what they are owed while giving renters a clean slate.

Children will not be expected to isolate if new rules are introduced that could spare double-jabbed travellers quarantine when they return from amber-list countries, government sources say.
Ministers are expected to discuss the plans at a meeting of the cabinet’s Covid-O committee, likely to be held on Thursday, where they will hear the latest scientific advice about when vaccination rates will be high enough to consider loosening quarantine requirements.

The document, which was obtained by The Intercept news website, was used in the US navy. It was entitled: Introduction to Terrorism/Terrorist Operations, and aimed at some members of the navy’s internal police, the outlet reported.

                    <span>The thrilling win over Portugal and easing of lockdown have transformed the mood of the people in the Bavarian capital
Leon Goretzka could hardly have captured the mood any better. “We already have the feeling there is a certain euphoria after the difficult year and a half that is behind all of us,” the Germany midfielder said. “It’s just nice that we have 82 million national team head coaches again, rather than 82 million virologists.”
The Nationalmannschaft are gathering momentum in a major competition and, all of a sudden, there is a sense of nature’s equilibrium being restored. In common with much of central Europe, a country is being allowed out of its shell; Covid-19 rates in Munich are at their lowest for 10 months and, with many restrictions having been lifted, there is a wildness in the midsummer air. Add to the mix a football team that have rediscovered their ability to inspire optimism and the confluence of circumstances is intoxicating. This city is not quite able to present the vivid, cosmopolitan extravaganza it became at the 2006 World Cup; nobody would have expected that this year. It pulsates with an emotional rawness that might not readily be associated with the Bavarian capital, though, and the feeling will crank up another notch on Wednesdaynight.

Lady Chapman, who was an early backer of Starmer’s leadership bid, will be shifted from her role as his political director to be a frontbench spokesperson on Brexit in the House of Lords, Labour sources confirmed on Tuesday.

The report, published by the Conservative-dominated Commons education committee on Tuesday, said schools could be breaking the law by promoting “divisive” terminology such as “white privilege”.

Both sides can still win but draw most likely result

Rain and bad light may have decimated the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand but the match heads into its reserve day with a result still possible following a gripping arm-wrestle between the two sides.
By the time stumps were called on day five India had reached 64 for two in their second innings with a lead of 32 runs. Virat Kohli was unbeaten on eight, his head still ringing after being struck by a Tim Southee bouncer late on, with Cheteshwar Pujara 12 not out following an hour of typical obduracy at the crease.

The furore caused by the ITV News report led three Labour MPs, including the chairs of the all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) on digital skills and data poverty, to demand a meeting with John Boumphrey, the country manager UK at Amazon.

The 39-year-old pop star has rarely commented on the unusual legal arrangement that has stripped her of her independence since 2008. But the records reviewed by the Times, which co-produced a documentary on the fraught process that led to the conservatorship, reveal that she has repeatedly objected to the authority that the courts granted her father, Jamie Spears.

What’s the subplot with the government’s latest flirtation with the idea of privatising Channel 4? There was a clue, possibly, in the view expressed this week by Tory MP Andrew Griffith, who has clout in these matters since he was a long-serving finance director of Sky.
In a column in the Telegraph, Griffith complained about how parochial UK competition regulators have stymied growth in the sector, missed the rise of on-demand streaming and failed to understand that UK-based TV players need scale to compete with the Americans. Specifically on Channel 4, he said: “Its next, and most enduring, contribution to the UK media landscape may be to keep some of its distinctive remit but as part of adding useful scale to another UK-based operator.”

You win some, you lose some. We’re still nowhere near finding out if the government has a coherent plan for tackling social care – only late on Monday the prime minister cancelled a meeting with Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock due to take place on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issue. So we can probably assume not. But we are a little better informed as to why the negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol have started to unravel badly. And that’s because every time he speaks, the UK’s lead Brexit negotiator, David Frost, doesn’t seem to be quite as bright as he would like us all to believe.
Tuesday’s appearance before the foreign affairs select committee was a case in point. Having established his credentials as being rather more important than a minister for Europe, Lord Frost then did his best to prove why he wasn’t really up to the job. He got off to a bad start by saying that the decision not to fully accredit the EU ambassador to the UK had been “over-interpreted” and that petty point scoring had been the last thing on the government’s mind. For some reason, the EU had seen it differently and taken offence.

                    <span>Ebrahim Raisi’s engineered win is dispiriting for those inside and outside the country. But the nuclear deal’s resurrection is still possible and necessary
The election of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi as Iran’s new president is a dispiriting moment for those in the west striving to revive the nuclear deal. The Iranian electorate is hardly more enthusiastic. Battered by the economic fallout from Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, the Covid pandemic and the inability of Hassan Rouhani’s reformist government to deliver on promises and overcome obstruction by the clergy and Revolutionary Guard, voters were offered only an engineered election in which Mr Raisi’s victory was all but certain.
While past elections were tightly controlled – and the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retained ultimate control regardless of the outcome – they have nonetheless been genuinely competitive. This time, leading reformists and centrists were removed as 600 candidates were whittled down; just four stood in the end. Mr Raisi’s 62% of the vote came on a turnout of 48%; in Tehran just 26% voted. While participation has at times been low, this was an all-time nadir for a presidential race in the Islamic Republic, and 3.7 million people spoiled their ballots.

                    <span>MPs ought to be embarrassed by a stunt designed to whip up animosity without addressing real problems of inequality and disadvantage
The chairman of parliament’s education select committee has produced a report designed not to illuminate a problem but divert attention from it. Conservative MP Robert Halfon and his colleagues think that “white working-class” pupils have fallen behind because of the use of terms such as “white privilege”. They suggest that there is an “industry” benefiting non-white people. This is a ludicrous culture war stunt to whip up animosity without addressing real and growing problems of inequality and disadvantage.
In Mr Halfon’s world, the “white working class” is the victim of unfair racial competition in which it is outperformed by other minority ethnic groups. The framing is incendiary, and, as the report admits, the data is ropey. Eligibility for free school meals is a crude proxy for disadvantage. The support goes to children with parents who are not usually working; or are not employed more than 16 hours a week; or have very low incomes. How can Mr Halfon make claims about the “white working class” when he is in fact talking about the poorest 13% of the total white cohort in English secondary schools?

A statement issued by Princess Latifa’s lawyers, purporting to come from the daughter of Dubai’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, declared she could now “travel where I want” a day after a picture of her in Madrid airport appeared online.
The brief remarks are the first time that Latifa has been quoted since her dramatic flight from the emirate three years ago, though the lawyers, Taylor Wessing, insisted they should only be reported as coming directly from the princess herself.

                    <span>Five years on from the referendum, few voters have seen the benefits of leaving the EU. What if they become impatient?
Doesn’t time fly? Five years ago we were going to the ballot box to cast our votes in the EU referendum. Now we are approaching 18 months since the UK ceased to be a member state. The transition period ended six months ago, yet, as the latest Ipsos Mori survey indicates, most of the British public still don’t think Brexit is over.
Overall, more than two in five think there are still “many important issues to finalise” and “lots more negotiations” to come, with a further one in four saying there are still “some important areas left to decide”. Even among leave voters, only one in five think the future relationship is “mostly decided and will hardly change”. They have a point. The full implications of the decision to leave the European Union have yet to be felt.

Downing Street has backed down from insisting that the Ministry of Defence should foot the whole bill for new royal yacht Britannia in a Whitehall row about the funding of the £200m vessel.
The funding dispute comes amid growing criticism from experts and senior politicians about the purpose of the project. The Tory peer and former chancellor, Ken Clarke, called it “silly populist nonsense” and a rear admiral described the plans as resembling an “oligarch’s yacht”.

The Australian government says it has been blindsided by a recommendation by official United Nations science advisers that the Great Barrier Reef be placed on the world heritage “in danger” list.
Australia’s ocean jewel is the world’s biggest coral reef system – celebrated and adored for its array of unique species and colourful corals, drawing tourists from around the world.

The touring squad is anxious to sidestep the Covid-19 self-isolation complications affecting the footballing plans of England and Scotland at the European Championship.
Gatland already has plenty on his plate before Sunday’s flight to an increasingly Covid-stricken South Africa, and could do without any squad members being forced to self-isolate for 10 days just as he is seeking to bring the best players from four nations closer together.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

A quarter of a million children in England missed school last week because of Covid infections, self-isolation or school closures, making it the most disrupted week since schools fully reopened in March and prompting calls for pupils to be vaccinated.
The upsurge has been most marked in northern centres such as Oldham, where Covid-related absences in schools are more than double the national rate. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said that self-isolation rules for children needed to be reformed to avoid further disruption to their education.

                    <span>Suspect Steve Bouquet charged with deaths and injuries of cats after CCTV footage found
A security guard has gone on trial accused of killing and injuring 16 cats in a spate of attacks that left police stumped for months.
Detectives in the UK had struggled to identify the attacker after receiving anguished reports from owners of nine pets that had been killed, and a further seven injured, in October 2018 and July 2019.
A court heard that despite the force launching an operation to investigate the deaths in Brighton and Hove, no suspect was identified until a CCTV system set up by an owner of a slain cat appeared to capture on camera a different attack, on a nine-month-old kitten.
Rowan Jenkins, prosecuting, told jurors: “In 2018 Sussex police commenced what became a major investigation following reports of domestic cats being targeted and deliberately stabbed in Brighton. Sometimes owners ... found that their cats were still alive and were able to take timely action to try and save them by rushing them to their vets.”

A memorial plaque honouring campaigner Paulette Wilson has been unveiled on the Wolverhampton building that used to house Enoch Powell’s constituency office, as part of a commemoration ceremony to mark Windrush Day.
Wilson, who died unexpectedly last year, aged 64, was one of the most vocal critics of the government over the Windrush scandal. In 2015 the former House of Commons canteen worker was misclassified by the Home Office as an illegal immigrant, and was twice arrested, before being detained and booked on to a flight back to Jamaica, the country where she was born, but had not visited in 49 years.

The judge, Mr Justice Swift, said he saw “no distinction” between a controversial talkshow host – or a “shock-jock”, as he put it – and career spies in Moscow seeking to disrupt British democracy. He turned down the cross-party group’s application for a judicial review.

You have to be something of a masochist to want to get into politics – and Zack Weiner is an unapologetic masochist. Last week, the 26-year-old, who is running for a place on the city council in New York, was something of a nonentity: he had zero name recognition and his campaign had raised just over $10,000 (£7,200), most of which he had donated himself.
Perhaps the most notable thing about Weiner was the fact his dad is the co-creator of the kids’ TV show Dora the Explorer. But that changed when a video of a man engaged in consensual sadomasochism was posted on Twitter by an anonymous account that claimed the man was Weiner. On Saturday, the New York Post ran a story about the video, complete with salacious screengrab. Pretty soon it made international headlines.

                    <span>Madeleine Worrall offers a solution that works well in Denmark while Peter Walker highlights a radical approach to empty properties that was used in the second world war. Plus letters from Jeremy Cushing and Andrew Beere
Re your editorial on second homes (21 June), there are useful models in European countries for the regulation of housing in rural and seaside communities. In Denmark (population around 5.5 million), there are around 200,000 summer houses. These cannot be used as year-round residences or bought by non-Danes without permission from the government.
This means that on a popular holiday island like Bornholm, local people can still afford homes because they live in houses classified as permanent residences, while Copenhageners, for instance, buy sensitively constructed holiday houses in peaceful wooded compounds that are controlled by strict planning laws. As they are generally attractive and well-built, there is no snobbery about them, in the way that there is in the UK, where purpose-built holiday accommodation is often in the form of static caravans, for instance, leading to wealthy incomers outpaying locals for picturesque houses in coastal villages.

                    <span>Carol Taylor reports that a Derbyshire arts extravaganza is put off for another year, while Jennifer Jenkins believes we are governed by philistines 
Arts festivals in towns and cities across Britain are suffering just as much as music festivals (Summer festivals are crying out for help – but the Tories don’t want to hear it, 20 June). The one in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, which has taken place for more than 30 years, centres on a “town trail” of more than 130 artists in 100 residents’ homes and public spaces, as well as curated exhibitions, performance, music, food stalls etc. As with a music festival, it takes us many months to put together, but again this year we will not be able to welcome the 5,000 people who used to visit the town on a September weekend. One of the reasons is worry about Covid-19 being passed on in people’s homes, but insurance is also a big factor. We just hope that after two years with no festival, people won’t forget us. 
Carol Taylor
Chair, Wirksworth festival
• I suspect that the reason hordes of sports fans are allowed to sing together in full voice while choirs are still restricted to socially distanced outdoor groups of up to 30 (Letters, 20 June) is that we are governed by a bunch of populist philistines.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Scotland should see the removal of all major legal coronavirus restrictions on 9 August, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she confirmed that the move to level O of her government’s five-tier system of Covid controls would be delayed until 19 July, the same date as measures are to be lifted in England.
This pause would allow more time for people to be vaccinated, the first minster said, with the daily case rate in Scotland 40% higher than it was last week as the Delta variant surges across the country.

The nation’s online shopping habit is causing a cardboard shortage as empty delivery boxes are hoarded in homes or stuck in council recycling bins.
UK households have amassed 135m cardboard boxes during the pandemic, keeping valuable raw material out of the recycling chain and pushing up packaging prices, according to the packaging specialist DS Smith.

A Manchester viaduct that has not been used for more than 50 years could reopen next summer as a transformed urban green space, with hopes it will emulate New York’s High Line as a “park in the sky”.
Trains ran on the Grade II listed Castlefield viaduct, built in 1892, to Manchester Central railway station until it closed in 1969.

“I predict there will be a new STD called ‘Covherpes’,” said comedian Chelsea Handler last week, joking about how our pent-up, pandemic sexual tension will play out once we are all vaccinated.
But, no matter what the results of our personal Hot Girl Summers (thanks, Megan Thee Stallion) /White Boy Summers (cheers, Chet Hanks) /Thot Girl Summers (hi BOLDiiPark) are, the consequences on fashion have been … unexpected. After dressing in sweatpants for most of 2020, the return to dressing up, the so called Roaring 20s, is not only about a desire to peacock but also to show off occasionally random bits of flesh. Welcome to the age of the intentional wardrobe malfunction.

Shareholders of firm backed by Matt Hancock have donated to the Tories

Dominic Cummings demanded senior civil servants pay half a million pounds to an external data team, according to leaked emails that show the prime minister’s then chief adviser urging officials to bypass government procedures.
On 22 March 2020, the day before Boris Johnson ordered the UK into full lockdown, Cummings instructed civil servants at NHSX, the government unit responsible for digital transformation in health, to grant the money to Our World in Data, a research project run by a not-for-profit organisation with Oxford academics.

Matt Hancock has promoted a healthcare startup whose shareholders have made donations to the health secretary and the Conservative party, the Guardian can reveal.
The revelations about investors in Babylon Healthcare, a startup that offers smartphone-based NHS GP consultations and symptom-checker services, raise questions about possible conflicts of interest for Hancock.

A ban on farm feed made of animal remains introduced during the BSE crisis is to be lifted in the EU to allow cheap pig protein to be fed to chickens over fears that European farmers are being undercut by lower standards elsewhere.
The change to the regulations come into force in August following a last-ditch attempt by a coalition of MEPs, led by the Greens, which failed on Tuesday to kill the policy. The EU’s member states have already endorsed the regulation, with only France and Ireland abstaining.

Eoin Morgan has dismissed controversy over tweets sent by him and Jos Buttler in 2017 and 2018 that appeared to mock common Indian use of English, insisting the problem is people “taking [them] out of context”.
The England and Wales Cricket Board is reportedly investigating the tweets, which notably overused the word “sir” for comedic effect. Asked how he has reflected on his own contribution to the issue of insensitive historical social media posts – after Ollie Robinson’s Test debut this month was overshadowed by the rediscovery of several problematic messages from nearly a decade ago – Morgan said: “I don’t really reflect on it a lot.

                    <span>Despite comments he made in the past, the director’s production company Amblin has signed a multi-picture deal with the streaming giant. Should cinephiles be worried?
Did another citadel just fall? Has another general just presented his sword in surrender? Steven Spielberg’s production company Amblin has signed a deal to produce multiple features a year for the streaming behemoth Netflix – which is precisely that small-screen player that Spielberg seemed to be rebuking two years ago when he proclaimed the importance of the theatrical experience and implied digital streaming content should not be eligible for Oscars. (Spielberg has since disputed the way his words were reported and interpreted.)
Well, now Spielberg has joined that other celluloid master, Martin Scorsese, in taking the Netflix dollar. Of course, this is not an exclusive deal: Amblin still has relationships with other studios, including Universal, and its own producing remit, after all, is for both film and television. It is also the case that Spielberg himself, though credited as a producer on them all, may not actually direct any of the films that are earmarked for Netflix. But it is still a mighty name for Netflix to have in the bag, and his prestige and the attendant coverage are still hugely important for the big streaming service, which is hyper-vigilant in its guarding against any slowing of momentum in subscription growth. We are, arguably, another step closer to the theatrical experience being just another aspect of the content rollout – a luxury loss-leader or promotional event, perhaps, while the main action involves consuming movies on laptops, tablets and even phones. Or are we approaching a postmodern cinema, which is a new version of its nickelodeon beginnings: watching flickering images once again on a tiny screen?

What is fairness? In sport, everything. From childhood, we come to see the head start in the playground race, the shove in the goalmouth, a rogue thumb on the egg (and spoon) as unjust, and quickly, loudly, “Oi!” object.
The same sense of probity works its way up into professional sport. Sandpapering a cricket ball: not fair. Boxing with loaded gloves: not fair. Intentional misrepresentation in Paralympic classification: not fair. Colluding with betting syndicates to fix a result: not fair. Doping in sport: not fair. We classify our sports in order to pitch like against like and to keep people safe. Heavyweight boxers never fight flyweights. From puberty, the sexes compete separately in most sports most of the time. These are long accepted norms. Or were.

A year locked up inside has done nothing to diminish the scale and scope of this year’s Jarman award nominees, whose work reflects on our unusual times, whether addressing the pandemic directly or offering dazzling escape routes from it.
Among the six shortlisted artists for the £10,000 prize, which is named after late film-maker Derek Jarman and recognises the innovative work of artist film-makers based in the UK, is Adham Faramawy, whose film, titled The air is subtle, various and sweet, is a meditation on the history of Wanstead Flats nature reserve in east London. It mentions how the area was turned into a makeshift mortuary during the height of the coronavirus crisis and enlists two dancers to tell a story about roots, belonging and the environment.

The figures, detailed in the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, capture how emergency interest rate cuts and government stimulus measures often benefited those least in need of state support, helping their assets grow in value despite the economic downturn.

                    <span>Brexit minister says EU move would be to the detriment of viewers but admits UK is powerless to prevent it
The EU would be harming itself by seeking to reduce the “disproportionate” amount of British content on European television but the government is powerless to stop it, the UK’s Brexit minister, Lord Frost, has said.
The Guardian revealed on Monday that the privileges that come with UK film and TV content being defined as “European” are under threat, with the risk of a major loss of the international sales used to finance some of Britain’s most popular programmes.

                    <span>She used to worry about ‘not making enough to pay the rent’. But with a solo show, a commission to make UK’s first Windrush monument and an OBE, the artist has stepped out of the shadows

Veronica Ryan’s handbag is always heavy. The British sculptor has been a collector since childhood, and her bag is her toolbox, her magpie’s nest, her anchor for a life lived in many places. It’s also fertile ground. Ryan’s mother once caught a glimpse of a date stone she was attempting to germinate in there. “You’re not going to get dates to grow here,” she said, referring to Britain and its climate. “I’m just really excited to see if I can,” replied Ryan. And she did.
Much like the seed, Ryan too is flourishing. For years, she worked in the art world’s shadows, using whatever materials she could find and often “not really making enough money to pay the rent”. But in 2018, aged 62, she won the Freelands award, which puts £100,000 towards showcasing a mid-career female artist yet to receive the recognition she deserves. The artist gets £25,000 and the gallery the remainder.

                    <span>Fallen from power, he is showing great promise as a poster – and we can’t get enough of his online revelations
Just thinking back on the bizarre fever dream of last summer, when Dominic Cummings drove to Barnard Castle and became the most hated man in Britain. Remember that? When he did the little press conference over a trestle table? It feels strange to look back on that moment of British culture now. Because we were all there, we were all involved. We were all doing very bizarre things in lockdowns one, two and three – downloading the Houseparty app, for instance – and for a hot week, being transcendentally angry at Dominic Cummings was one of them. We’ll have to explain this to our children, one day. “Well, it was 2020 and nobody really knew if it was legal to leave the house or not,” we’ll say. “The isolation was doing very strange things to all our heads. Dominic Cummings – a very bald man who loved bluebells and had a blog 15 years after anyone else in the universe did – worked for the government and we were all very angry at him. No, I don’t remember precisely why.”
Anyway, he’s back. I feel like this will be a biweekly occurrence until I die now, actually: Dominic Cummings “coming back”, either by dropping a blogpost or doing a tweet or appearing in front of a hearing or bullying Matt Hancock so hard he has to meekly tell assembled press through a union jack face mask that he doesn’t think he’s hopeless. Cummings’ latest back-coming move was to drop WhatsApp screenshots of Boris Johnson at the start of a pandemic – and nothing soothes the soul quite like knowing the prime minister of the country, a man who messes his own hair up for photo opportunities because it’s the only thing that takes the burn off his palpable Eton-ness, actually responded to a pandemic with a panicked “Wtf?” at 10.18pm.

                    <span>Marco Pontecorvo’s account of the Virgin Mary’s radiant appearance in 1917 Portugal finds little space for doubt, nor drama
Picking fault with faith films on dramatic grounds is like objecting to explicit sex scenes for being “boring”. Believers may well be swept away by this glossy account of the 1917 Miracle of the Sun in Fátima, Portugal – witnessed by 30,000 people and already the subject of feature films in 1952 and 2009. But given the inherent lack of drama in the kind of unbreakable faith on display here, anyone wishing to tell the story needs to work much harder than this laboured treatment to wring any nuance, conflict or indeed true sublimity from it.
To be fair, director Marco Pontecorvo – son of The Battle of Algiers’ Gillo – doesn’t disgrace himself on the latter front. There’s an undeniable sacred frisson as Mediterreanean winds caress the olive trees and invisible feet flatten the saltgrass, as the Virgin Mary first visits three young shepherds Lúcia, Jacinta and Francisco, and anoints them as her messengers. The trio quickly attract followers among a war-weary populace eager for deliverance. But others think Lucia (Stephanie Gil) is just seeking attention, including the rational-minded mayor, eager to get a public order nightmare under control, and her own devout mother Maria Rosa (Lúcia Moniz), worried her daughter’s presumptuousness will anger Him upstairs.

The pandemic has been a tough time for swimmers. Lockdowns and tier systems meant swimming pools were closed for more days than they were open. Outdoor swimming spots were only for use by those local enough to access them easily.
However, despite the restrictions, there has been a huge surge in the popularity of swimming, particularly outdoor swimming in ponds, lakes, reservoirs or the sea.

Which vegetables work best in sweet bakes? 
Emma, Suffolk
“I don’t know why we stopped at carrots,” says baker Lily Jones, founder of Lily Vanilli in east London. “Vegetables add a wonderful and unexpected depth of flavour, are a great source of moisture and yield a lovely texture.” Plus, it’s never a bad thing to up your veg quota.

                    <span>If 2,500 of the ‘football family’ get a free pass into England, the double standards of our self-isolation rules will be laid bare
How encouraging to see Uefa masterminding a return of jeopardy to the Euros. Not in the football, you understand – putting four third-place teams through simply further deflates the group stages of an already format-compromised 24-team tournament. But threatening last week to take the final away from Wembley and move it to Hungary unless 2,500 of their dignitaries can swerve quarantine – well, this is the stuff of which perilous thrills are made.
Not that a Budapest final wouldn’t offer something fresh: large numbers of openly racist and homophobic fans who are finally under investigation by Uefa for their conduct thus far during the tournament. The governing body has sensationally abandoned its high-level probe into German captain Manuel Neuer’s decision to wear a rainbow armband, and seems to be belatedly taking a look at “potential discriminatory incidents” at Hungary games against both Portugal and France . Honestly, you don’t get into football policing for that, do you? Sad when public eyebrow-raising means you get pulled off the equivalent of an unpaid parking ticket and required instead to waste your time on something far bigger – but I guess that’s life in the governing body’s crack investigations unit.

Midnight Trains is hoping post-Covid interest in cleaner, greener travel will generate interest in its proposed “hotels on rails”, which aims to connect the French capital to 12 other European destinations, including Edinburgh.

On his first day at the White House, Joe Biden earned praise for following through on several campaign promises, committing the US to strict climate goals and a greener future. Now, nearly six months into his presidency, several of those commitments are being put to the test, and already, many are falling apart.
A court last week ruled that the Biden administration did not have the authority to unilaterally pause oil and gas lease sales across the US. The decision came alongside news that congressional bargaining over Biden’s climate and infrastructure bill is hitting a wall with Republicans and the administration is now considering a slimmed-down version.

The Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont is synonymous with suspension and breakdown but even when it is sitting it warps the concept of power-sharing, according to a study to mark its 100th birthday on Tuesday.

Opened officially by King George V in 1921, the assembly was suspended in 1972 during the Troubles. The legislature was reconstituted under the 1998 Good Friday agreement to underpin peace and stability in a new Northern Ireland but has become a hyper-polarised forum.

                    <span>As party girl Marissa in The OC, Barton found fame at a time when young female stars were being hounded by the press. She talks about strength, resilience and her battle against revenge porn
For some actors, the roles they have played stick to them like shadows, long after they should have been left behind. Just ask Mischa Barton. It is 15 years since she starred as Marissa Cooper in the teen drama The OC, and yet still she can’t shake her off. When Barton appeared in the reality show The Hills in 2019 – inspired by The OC’s privileged young Californians but featuring real-life people – she was supposed to be herself, but the producers expected Cooper. “It is the constant mistake,” she says wryly. “They were even calling me by my character name. Seriously? Like, this far down the line they can’t get my name right?”
The parallels, though, are irresistible. Marissa was a troubled party girl with a love of fashion who met a tragic end. Mischa (even their names are similar) was also a troubled party girl with a love of fashion, whose life at times seemed out of control. There was the extreme fame, the breakdown, the reported threats of suicide, estrangement from her parents and a “revenge porn” court case. Barton has weathered it all with a sense of humour and now, at 35, a bit of perspective.

                    <span>Defensive end is league’s first active player to come out as gay
Stars including JJ Watt and Julian Edelman welcome decision

Carl Nassib’s decision to come out as gay, the first time an active NFL player has chosen to do so, was welcomed across the league from coaches and teams to some of the biggest names in the sport.
It is hardly a secret that gay players have always existed in the NFL, but a fear of a backlash from fans, teammates and their employers stopped them from doing so. Now times appear to be slowly changing.

                    <span>Funds were intended to address discriminatory policies – but ‘promises to Black farmers are always put on hold’
The US Department of Agriculture was scheduled to begin sending out payments to Black and minority farmers this month, as part of a $4bn loan forgiveness program included in the $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill that passed Congress in March.
But a lawsuit on behalf of white farmers accusing the Biden administration of discrimination has, at least temporarily, stopped the checks, prompting dismay among Black farmers and campaigners.

The airy restaurant-cum-reception of Eastbourne’s newest hotel, Port, has blush pink walls hung with local art above mid-century modern furniture, and is filled with the clatter of sharing plates being passed around. Sitting here, I find it hard to imagine how this boutique newcomer could provoke any controversy.
Yet it did. Before Port opened its doors in May, a local Facebook page was flooded with comments. Residents argued about the black facade standing out from the traditional white seafront buildings. Was Port adding a touch of modern design to the town and broadening its appeal; or ruining the very essence of this grand seaside spot?

                    <span>They may be vine-smothered ruins today, but the lost cities of the ancient tropics still have a lot to teach us about how to live alongside nature
Visions of “lost cities” in the jungle have consumed western imaginations since Europeans first visited the tropics of Asia, Africa and the Americas. From the Lost City of Z to El Dorado, a thirst for finding ancient civilisations and their treasures in perilous tropical forest settings has driven innumerable ill-fated expeditions. This obsession has seeped into western societies’ popular ideas of tropical forest cities, with overgrown ruins acting as the backdrop for fear, discovery and life-threatening challenges in countless films, novels and video games.
Throughout these depictions runs the idea that all ancient cities and states in tropical forests were doomed to fail. That the most resilient occupants of tropical forests are small villages of poison dart-blowing hunter-gatherers. And that vicious vines and towering trees – or, in the case of The Jungle Book, a boisterous army of monkeys – will inevitably claw any significant human achievement back into the suffocating green whence it came. This idea has been boosted by books and films that focus on the collapse of particularly enigmatic societies such as the Classic Maya. The decaying stone walls, the empty grand structures and the deserted streets of these tropical urban leftovers act as a tragic warning that our own way of life is not as secure as we would like to assume.

A new wave of Covid-19 cases is threatening to disrupt another summer in the UK as the government extends restrictions for England into July amid concern about the rate of spread of the Delta variant. 
The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Anushka Asthana that this time around we are in a very different position with most adults now having had two vaccine jabs. However, there is still a prospect of a sharp rise in Covid cases and with it more hospital admissions and deaths. Boris Johnson has said cases of the Delta variant are rising at about 30% a week.

                    <span>More than 12 years have passed since xenophobic violence swept unexpectedly through South Africa’s townships, leaving more than 60 people dead, hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced from their homes. Photojournalists James Oatway and Alon Skuy document the unrest in a new book, [BR]OTHER
In May 2008, a series of xenophobic attacks accompanied by widespread looting and vandalism left at least 62 people dead, 1,700 injured and 100,000 displaced in South Africa. The violence began in Alexandra in Johannesburg after a local community meeting at which migrants were blamed for crime and for “stealing” jobs. Within days the attacks had spread around the country, with Ramaphosa settlement on the East Rand becoming one of the areas that witnessed inhumanity on an unthinkable level.

New rules on chemicals to be debated by the EU this week would allow most polymers to be used without further checks, according to a group of scientists.
Only about 6% out of about 200,000 polymers would require extensive safety checks under proposals being discussed as part of Europe’s Reach chemicals regulations.

                    <span>Ten years since the Arab spring rocked Egypt and removed its president, the country is still detaining human rights workers and locking up political prisoners
Karim Ennarah, a human rights worker for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, was at a beach resort in South Sinai when he was arrested and accused of joining a terrorist group and “spreading false news”. He was detained in a prison in Cairo and became one of thousands of political prisoners in the country. 
Ennarah tells Anushka Asthana that his arrest was only the beginning of his separation from his British wife. Jess Kelly describes to Anushka the moment that she found out her husband had been arrested by the security services as she rode her bike along a London street, and the great difficulties she herself has faced to be reunited with him.

The head of climate change at the UN has warned that world leaders are still “far away” from securing a deal to limit the disastrous effects of global heating, with less than five months to go before a key summit in Glasgow.
Time is now running out, said Patricia Espinosa, who was formerly foreign minister of Mexico but now leads the UN on climate policy. She told the Observer that although advances had been made at the G7 meeting in Cornwall last weekend, progress had not been made on honouring past commitments to find $100bn (£72.5bn) a year to help developing countries invest in green technologies.

The catalyst was a proposed tax hike, since withdrawn, in response to the coronavirus crisis. Demands expanded to calls to end inequality, economic disparity and police violence in Colombia – in almost two months, demonstrations have caused food and goods shortages.
Protest leaders have temporarily suspended in-person demonstrations due to a rise in Covid cases, but Joe Parkin Daniels, reporting for the Guardian, explains why this widespread discontent is unlikely to end

                    <span>England’s footballers will take the knee before their match against Scotland at Wembley tonight in an anti-racism protest that has divided supporters. Liam Rosenior and Paul MacInnes reflect on how football became enmeshed in the culture wars
When England’s footballers took to the pitch for their first match of Euro 2020 last Sunday they felt the weight of expectation as one of the tournament’s hotly tipped sides. But after a loudly bellowed national anthem, the team dropped to one knee on the Wembley turf for the anti-racism act that has become a mainstay of English football for the past year. Some of their own supporters loudly booed before the majority drowned them out in applause. 
Liam Rosenior, a former professional footballer currently on the coaching staff at Derby County, tells Anushka Asthana of his sadness but not surprise at the booing. He takes apart the argument that the players are making an overtly political statement and chastises politicians who he believes have sought to use the issue to inflame existing tensions. The Guardian’s sports reporter Paul MacInnes delves into the history of the gesture itself, which gained traction in the US on the back of the long-running anti-racism protest made by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
