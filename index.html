Keira Knightley has spoken about how sexual harassment is such a big problem she “literally” does not know any woman who has not been subjected to it, including herself.
The British actor said that, from groping to being flashed, “everybody” has been harassed in some way.

Cyril Derreumaux set out from the coastal town of Sausalito, California, on 31 May, headed for Hawaii in what was supposed to be an epic 70-day voyage across the Pacific to Hawaii.
But his hopes of paddling solo from the mainland to the islands were cut short over the weekend by rough seas and high winds.

A “powerful new watchdog” is to be created to tackle abuse by unscrupulous employers and name and shame big brands that turn a blind eye to exploitation of workers by their suppliers, the government has said.
However, the Labour party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) criticised the “heavy on spin but light on action” proposals, saying the body would do little to change the insecure working conditions faced by many and highlighting that there was no timetable for its introduction.

UK retail sales surged in May by the most since the Covid-19 pandemic began as shoppers returned to high streets across the country after lockdown measures were relaxed, according to industry figures.
The British Retail Consortium said total sales increased by 10% in May compared with the same month in 2019, before Covid-19 hit consumer spending and tipped the UK into recession.

Electoral officials have announced plans for the biggest shake-up of parliamentary constituencies in England in decades, one that critics immediately warned would break up many recognisable communities because of an overly strict set of rules.
Among those affected would be Keir Starmer. The initial plan for the Labour leader’s London seat of Holborn and St Pancras would see it significantly rejigged and renamed as Kentish Town and Bloomsbury.

When a full moon rises, many people will pull out their mobile phones to try and get an Instagram-worthy photograph, but unfortunately the moon is really challenging to get a great photo of.
Two reasons: it is very far away and unless you have a telephoto lens (which makes the moon appear closer than it is) it will always appear as a very small glowing dot in the frame.

Abdul Elahi, 26, admitted a host of charges – thought to be among the highest number of offences one individual has ever pleaded guilty to – after a lengthy investigation, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

Two women, aged 74 and 44, a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl – a grandmother, mother, father and their teenage daughter – were killed on Sunday night when Nathaniel Veltman ploughed his black pickup truck into a group of pedestrians in the city of London, Ontario, police said.

The thought has occurred all too frequently during England’s Euro 2020 warm-up games: thank goodness it was not the finals. Can you imagine if these kind of errors, some rooted in the all-consuming desire to impress, in players essentially losing their composure, had happened, say, against Croatia in the opening group game on Sunday?

                    <span>This new Irish drama expertly manages a large cast of characters, with seeds of suspicion, red herrings – and a monstrous patriarch left for dead
Smother (Alibi), a new County Clare-set thriller by novelist and television writer Kate O’Riordan, reminds me – and I have few higher compliments – of the work of Maeve Binchy, if she had ever turned her hand to whodunnits. It has a seemingly effortless mastery of a large cast of characters, warm intelligence pervading everything, and promotes the gorgeous general sense of being held for the duration in a very safe pair of hands indeed. Like Binchy, it is also entirely addictive.
It opens with an altercation on a clifftop that ends with a man dead on the beach below. Then, as is currently TV fashion, we spool back to earlier that night, as successful businessman Denis (Stuart Graham) hosts his wife Val’s (Dervla Kirwan) 50th birthday party. Their three daughters are there – Jenny (Niamh Walsh), a heavily pregnant single doctor who works eternally for Daddy’s approval, Anna (Gemma-Leah Devereux), who is in the final stages of a custody battle with her husband Rory’s ex-wife for the latter’s two sons, and Grace (Seána Kerslake), the fragile youngest, struggling with mental illness and currently off her medication.

Sinckler was controversial omission from original squad

Kyle Sinckler has urged Warren Gatland to “put me on the field” after earning a British &amp; Irish Lions reprieve with the Bristol and England prop determined to prove he deserves his place in the squad following his late call-up.
Sinckler was the shock omission from the original 37-man squad but when Ireland’s Andrew Porter was ruled out with a toe injury he received the call from Gatland on Sunday morning. By his own admission, Sinckler had written off any hopes of touring South Africa after processing the initial disappointment last month – plain for all to see in an emotional interview days after the squad announcement.

The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware taskforce created by the Biden administration, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world.

Apple has paid a multi-million dollar settlement to an Oregon woman after iPhone repair technicians uploaded explicit images and videos to the internet from a phone that she sent in for repair.
Legal filings, first reported on by the Telegraph, revealed the unnamed woman sent her iPhone for repair on 14 January 2016 to an Apple-approved repair contractor called Pegatron Technology Service in California. Technicians there then uploaded “extremely personal and private material” to the woman’s Facebook account and other internet locations, the documents said.

                    <span>Russian scientists find bdelloid rotifers deep in remote permafrost
A microscopic worm-like creature, labelled an “evolutionary scandal” by biologists for having thrived for millions of years without having sex, has now been shown to persist for at least 24,000 years in Siberian permafrost and then reproduce, researchers have found.
Multicellular invertebrates that are solely female, bdelloid rotifers are already renowned for their resistance to radiation and ability to withstand rather inhospitable environments: drying, starvation and low oxygen. They’ve also existed for at least 35m years – and can be found today in freshwater lakes, ponds, streams and moist terrestrial habitats such as moss, lichen, tree bark and soil.

                    <span>Speaker did not accept amendment on foreign aid, instead opting for a vote that would not be legally binding
Lindsay Hoyle is learning how to work an audience. When the Speaker announced that he would not be accepting Andrew Mitchell’s amendment to restore the government’s commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid, you could almost hear the cheers in Downing Street. The potential for major embarrassment ahead of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Cornwall had been averted.
Or not. Because moments later, Hoyle went on to say that he would be open to an emergency debate the following day if one were to be requested. In a point of order, Mitchell needed no second invitation. He assured the house he had the necessary numbers to win by a majority of between nine and 20 and, though disappointed the vote would not now be legally binding, the debate would give parliament the chance to express its will on the government’s unilateral decision to break its manifesto commitment and cut overseas aid by 0.2%. Hoyle looked on in satisfaction. It felt good not to be the complete pushover that many had feared after all. Being a bit of a pushover was just fine.

Boris Johnson has set himself on a collision course with scores of his MPs as No 10 suggested it would defy an order by the House of Commons speaker to bring a vote on swingeing foreign aid cuts.
Between 40 and 50 Conservative MPs were said to be considering defying the government on Monday before an ambush in the Commons was thwarted, with rebels now exploring options including legal action.

It is sometimes said that national teams are no longer in keeping with the times. In fact, the concept of nation is historically burdened, especially in Europe. But it is not only a suitable form that organises our coexistence well. Nation also creates identification.
And so a competition of nations, a European Championship, strengthens the European idea. Through the playfulness of football, it can even serve international understanding in the broadest sense, because everyone acts according to the same rules and many people from many different regions participate, whether as players or fans.

Turning off building lights at night can save migrating birds from crashing into buildings, a study based on decades of research has shown.
Scientists found that on nights when half the windows of a large building in Chicago were darkened, there were 11 times fewer bird collisions during spring migration and six times fewer collisions during autumn migration than when all the windows were lit.

Researchers at the University of Oxford found that those who stopped maths after their GCSEs had less gamma-aminobutyric acid, a chemical which is crucial for brain plasticity, than counterparts who pursued maths post-16.

Voters also showed little enthusiasm for Mexico’s rightwing opposition, which remains reviled after its decisive 2018 defeat by López Obrador, who swept to power promising to curb corruption and put the poor first.

In a tricky hour-long defence of the additional £1.4bn catch-up funding offer, which caused uproar when it was announced last week, Williamson attempted to placate his critics promising that more was to come including a review of the length of the school day to maximise on catch-up.

A global agreement on the taxation of multinationals, including the shape-shifting tech giants, seemed impossible until it came into view at the weekend.
There are hurdles to be cleared, of course. The G7 nations need to win support from elsewhere. Important details around how profits and profit margins are calculated need to be thrashed out. Meanwhile, the centrepiece – a global minimum tax rate of 15% – is not as ambitious as originally advertised. But one can say the accord is now more likely than not to bring about the first change in multinational taxation in a century. That is a major shift.

                    <span>The government’s plan to slash £4bn from development spending is regressive and must be overturned 
Boris Johnson does not share the liberal belief in progress. “I think that history – societies and civilizations and nations – can rise and fall, and I think that things can go backwards,” he said recently in an interview for The Atlantic, an American magazine. There could be few neater demonstrations of this acceptance of historical regression than the government’s decision to cut the UK’s aid budget by £4bn, which dominated the news just hours after the article was published.
To those who believe the aim of politics must be a brighter and more stable future, in which poverty has been eliminated and the risks of runaway global heating contained, the UK’s promise to spend 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid is a powerful symbol. It signals recognition of the obligations of rich nations and people to poorer ones, and a commitment to global cooperation. These ideas are widely shared, for reasons that range from a progressive internationalism to a belief that British “soft power” is part of its role as a former imperial power.

The decision by the England football squad to “take the knee” was a landmark in recognising that racism is a pernicious blight on the game. This has been a slow process spanning decades, but it has gained momentum since the murder of George Floyd last year. There is a crisis in the sport: black players, who are over-represented on the pitch, are abused on and off it.
Non-white footballers in the world’s richest league face horrendous racism online. Racist match taunts have not disappeared. The England football team has debated walking off the pitch rather than putting up with abuse. Footballers in Euro 2020 ought to be congratulated for pre-match kneeling to show their opposition to racism.

                    <span>As Amazon founder prepares to jet off in his Blue Origin vessel, can he compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX?

Jeff Bezos to go into space on first crewed flight of New Shepard rocket

Every billionaire needs something to spend their fortunes on. For Howard Hughes, it was the Spruce Goose; for Roman Abramovich, it’s Chelsea FC. And for the current crop of tech moguls, it’s space.
Jeff Bezos has led the charge. He founded his company, Blue Origin, in 2000, after a conversation with his friend, the science fiction author Neal Stephenson. And in July, 21 years later, the investment will pay off: Bezos will blast himself, his brother, and a third fee-paying guest 100km up in the company’s New Shepard rocket, brushing the edge of space until he comes back down to earth three minutes later.

Organisers fear ‘impasse that could drag on’

It is the news that more than 200,000 weekly devotees of parkrun across England have been dreading: its return is almost certain to be delayed again despite three-quarters of events now having approval to restart.
The major stumbling block, the Guardian can reveal, is the low number of permissions from councils in several major cities. While 427 out of 564 events now have permission to resume, barely half the parkruns in London and Manchester have got the all clear. The situation in Newcastle and Middlesbrough is even worse, with no events currently allowed.

                    <span>Culture secretary says board’s action is ‘over the top’
England head coach says impossible to dismiss tweets

The prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the sports minister, Oliver Dowden, have both criticised the England and Wales Cricket Board’s decision to suspend the bowler Ollie Robinson from international cricket while it conducts an investigation into historic offensive tweets published in 2012 and 2013, with Dowden insisting the move was “over the top”.
Robinson excelled on debut in England’s first Test against New Zealand, which ended in a draw on Sunday, taking seven wickets and scoring 42 in the first innings, a total bettered only by the centurion Rory Burns. His performance was all the more impressive for having been played out amid the controversy caused by the tweets, which were rediscovered and widely distributed as play progressed on the opening day. His suspension was announced on Sunday night, ruling him out of the second match which starts in Birmingham on Thursday, and potentially beyond.

Essential oils can have many healing and nurturing effects, not only on us humans but our dogs too. Dogs with generalised anxiety, noise phobias or separation anxiety may benefit from aromatherapy – specifically lavender essential oil.
It’s important to only use essential oils that are 100% pure and to choose essential oils that are safe for your dog. These treatments are no substitute for quality veterinary care, and you should consult with your vet before using any essential oil.

As someone with a complex autoimmune history, I consulted widely before making my Covid vaccine decision. I read all the research I could find, I spoke to all my specialists. I chose to have the AstraZeneca vaccine on the best medical advice and research available to me. Twenty-four hours later, I was in ambulance.
Back in 2012, I had a rare autoimmune disease called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which caused my immune system to shred my nervous system. Years later I have most of my arm and leg function back and only the odd bout of nerve pain. I’m considered one of the lucky ones. I didn’t die. But with such a twitchy immune system, vaccines are risky for me.

The Global Gaming Awards, convened by industry publication Gambling Insider, honours the top companies and executives for their achievements during the year. The awards for 2020 will be judged by a 52-strong panel that “represents a dynamic cross-section of the global gaming industry”, according to a published shortlist of nominees.

They can shrink the state with fiscal austerity, but they can diminish it, too, by imposing state-shrinkers on its controlling heights. Not since the Victorians abolished patronage with open competition has any government so ruthlessly ushered its placemen into every nook and cranny of the public realm. To appoint Dido Harding as NHS England chief executive – she told the BBC’s Woman’s Hour that she’s considering applying – would signal a slide back to the dark ages of influence.
With a Downing Street nod, she’s in the running. From the world of business, with no NHS experience, she was made chair of NHS Improvement, overseeing all trusts. Again, without contest, she was put in charge of the test-and-trace project, possibly the most notorious public administration disaster in living memory.

The settlement with the French competition authority, which found that Google unfairly favoured its own tools for buying and selling adverts online over those of rivals, marks the first time the Silicon Valley company has agreed to make changes to its practices as a result of the investigation.

                    <span>Ian Flintoff and Teresa McDonnell on notions of beauty, age and women in response to an article on Kate Winslet
Gaby Hinsliff (Kate Winslet shows there’s more to middle age than a saggy belly, 3 June) raises a question of massive importance to women, but also to us all. It is a myth that humans are less beautiful as they age – on the contrary. Years ago, to help me to understand things better, I got a season ticket to a Rembrandt exhibition. Many hours, day after day, taught me that, with the more truthful eyes of the artist, age is an etching of beauty on the more stereotyped images that are thrust upon us by adverts, pin-ups and porn. If the rosebush had eyes, it would peer at any human with wonder and exclaim: “How can anything of such wonder, beauty and complexity possibly exist?”
An analogy I often use is of the flashy cover on the latest novel in a bookshop, comparing this with the patina, beauty and handcrafting of an antique volume in a museum. Things – and people – lose beauty with age? No! The opposite is the case by any other than the most superficial standards of self-interest.

I am saddened that Ava Ayala Rosenbaum believes 70-year-olds live a locked-down life, with or without a pandemic (Gen Z special report, 2 June). It’s not something I recognise. Most of us have lives filled with purpose, direction, passion and social connections – maybe not as much as a 22-year-old, but still fulfilling. We may not spend much time musing, but we do quite a bit of doing. We may not qualify for a midlife crisis, but we can do a “silver swerve” if the mood takes us.
I hope Ava Ayala doesn’t spend the next 50 years dreading her 70s. It would be a waste of her obvious intelligence, drive and spirit, and do more damage than any pandemic.

The Home Office uses the contractor Mitie to deport people to destinations including Jamaica, Pakistan, India, Nigeria and Ghana along with European countries and other locations. The escorts are only allowed to do this work if they have received accreditation from the Home Office.

Without Eric McGraw, who has died aged 76, there would have been no Inside Time, the national newspaper for prisoners and detainees. McGraw, a social justice campaigner, created the title in the wake of the Strangeways riot in 1990.
At the time he was director of the prisoner befriending charity New Bridge, co-founded by the prison reformer Lord (Frank) Longford to provide supportive links between prisoners and the community. In that capacity McGraw attended the subsequent Woolf inquiry into the riot. “I was just sitting listening and learning and straight away it occurred to me that one of the reasons this had happened was that the prisoners had no voice,” he told me later.

Too many film and television bosses still do not understand the value of intimacy coordinators and hire them purely as a box-ticking exercise, one of the industry’s leading figures has said.
Ita O’Brien was celebrated on Sunday by the actor and writer Michaela Coel, who dedicated her best actress Bafta to the “essential” work she did on I May Destroy You. Coel spoke powerfully of the “internal devastation” she had felt working on shows that had no intimacy coordinator.

Coronavirus – latest updates

African countries face a last-ditch battle against a third wave of Covid infections, as the supply of vaccines to the continent “grinds to a halt”, top health officials have warned.
“The threat of a third wave in Africa is real and rising. Our priority is clear – it’s crucial that we swiftly get vaccines into the arms of Africans at high risk of falling seriously ill and dying of Covid-19,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa.

                    <span>Usefulness of aducanumab is disputed but US approval will trigger push to make it available globally

A controversial new drug for Alzheimer’s disease, the first in nearly 20 years, was approved in the US on Monday, which will trigger pressure to make it available worldwide in spite of mixed evidence over its efficacy.
While doctors, patients and the organisations that support them are desperate for treatments that can slow mental deterioration, the usefulness of the new drug, aducanumab, is disputed by scientists. Two trials were stopped in March 2019 because the drugs appeared not to work. The manufacturer, Biogen, said the drugs were unlikely to improve people’s memory and thinking.

                    <span>Legislature seeks to strip funding of Hawaii’s largest tourism agency, just as it refocuses on community and environment
Since 1998, the Hawaiian Tourism Authority (HTA) – the state’s leading agency to manage tourism – has had its focus largely on marketing Hawaii to the world. But in 2019, when the state hit a record of over 10 million tourists, the milestone taxed residents, and caused significant environmental impacts on trails, beaches and sacred sites.
During the pandemic, the agency’s new leader, John De Fries, called the time a “huliau”, which in Hawaiian means a time of transition. It was one that De Fries, the first Native Hawaiian in the role, felt would be the perfect moment to reset Hawaii in a way that would marry modern technology and Indigenous wisdom to protect the future of the island and promote its state-adopted sustainability goals by 2030.

The health secretary said he was “cheered” by recent scenes of young people queueing to get their injections, telling the Commons: “The enthusiasm for the jab is not just the preserve of older generations.”

                    <span>For reasons unclear, an online bingo site has decided to find out which Disney film the most people have tattooed on to themselves 

I do not have any tattoos. This is because I am afraid of pain, and also because I worry that permanently advertising one of my enthusiasms on my body would open me up even further to scorn and ridicule from strangers. However, many people do have tattoos, and many of those people have tattoos of licensed Disney properties.
Which begs the question: which Disney property has inspired the greatest number of tattoos? I’m glad you definitely asked, because the scientists employed by the website Online Bingo have worked it out, based on the number of Instagram hashtags that correlate with each Disney movie. Will this methodology provide us with the most accurate data? No. Why is an online bingo site wasting its precious resources on counting hashtags? Nobody knows. Will this change anybody’s life in the slightest? No it won’t. But, look, we’re already two paragraphs into this thing, so we might as well see it through.

Some of my friends have no idea I even exist. These are people I know intimately, extensively, profoundly: I know what they had for dinner last night, the petty arguments they have at home, their obsessions, their insecurities, their fears, what time they wake up in the morning. No piece of minutiae is too minute, no idle thought too inconsequential, no detail too mundane: I want to hear it all.
If this is beginning to sound slightly alarming, I should point out that they tell me all of these things – and try to make me laugh in the process. I think of podcasters as my friends – and I am not alone.

                    <span>The Delta variant is surging, and the government’s failure to act quickly will likely cost lives

A new coronavirus variant that was first sequenced in India has been doubling about every eight days in England since early April. The Delta variant is now dominant in England, and according to a recent risk assessment from Public Health England (PHE), it has a substantially increased rate of transmissibility compared with the previously dominant variant Alpha, which was first sequenced in the UK. Having just a single dose of vaccination is less effective against Delta, and it may lead to a surge in hospital cases.
We always knew variants were a risk to England’s roadmap out of lockdown. In January, the science advisory group Sage warned that England’s red-list border policy of “geographically targeted travel bans” was unlikely to keep new variants out, not least because we didn’t know where the next one would come from. England spent the winter trying to keep out the Beta variant, first sequenced in South Africa, and the Gamma variant, first detected in Japan in travellers from Brazil. The effort mostly succeeded, but the government’s red-list policy entirely missed the rise of a dangerous new variant in India.

High-profile defence lawyers have often become celebrities in the US, starting with Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln and boasting ever more flamboyance since the days of Clarence Darrow.
F Lee Bailey, who has died aged 87, was one of the most aggressively self-promoting modern celebrity lawyers, achieving fame then maintaining it through the defence of notable clients. In the mid-1960s Bailey attracted headlines by winning a reversal for Sam Sheppard, a doctor convicted of the killing of his wife in one of US’s most important murder trials; one that provided the inspiration for the hit television show and film The Fugitive. He went on to represent, not always successfully, clients as notorious as the Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, or as controversial as the heiress Patty Hearst.

GB Gymnastics has been accused of sending a sinister warning to whistleblowers by dropping the 2019 world silver medallist, Becky Downie, from its Olympic team for Tokyo. The surprise decision came less than a year after Downie spoke out about an “environment of fear” in the organisation.
Downie tweeted: “Winning an Olympic gold medal has always been my dream. I don’t have the words to describe how it feels now not being able to even try. This past year has been incredibly difficult, but this last month has been unimaginable. I’m not sure what will happen in terms of my future, but all I know is that I still love the sport, and I feel like I’m in the form of my life.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

While most of the world suffered through hundreds of millions of cases and millions of deaths from Covid-19, the 23.5 million people in Taiwan largely lived a normal life, thanks to a well-documented strong and early response that saw it go 250 days without a single local case. It lobbied for inclusion in the World Health Organization’s decision-making body off the back of its undeniable success and expertise under the slogan “Taiwan can help”.
But now the tables have turned and the island itself is in need of assistance, after an outbreak that started among airline staff in April spread across the island. The government appears to have been caught short by something it thought would never happen: the poster child for outbreak prevention had apparently failed to fully prepare an outbreak response.

This week’s planned G7 chat on Northern Ireland between the US president, Joe Biden, and British prime minister, Boris Johnson, can be brief. Biden should tell Johnson to stop being an idiot and honour the protocol.
Everyone knows there can be no erecting of a border across the fields of Ireland. Johnson knew that when he campaigned for Brexit. He knew it when he decided to leave the single market. If he promised Northern Ireland’s unionists something else, he was lying. He should get busy preparing EU-compatible customs barriers in Belfast, as required by the protocol. Biden might add that Johnson can forget any US/UK trade deal if he refuses, not that any deal agreed by Congress is ever likely to be in Britain’s interest.

Modern Toss on superhero attire

In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it, once and for all
When saving the planet, it’s important to dress the part. This isn’t like taking the bins out. You can’t hang off a chopper in a slanket and Crocs. Superheroes understand this. Unlike James Bond – who is permanently tuxed up as if he’s about to host a pharmaceutical industry awards bash – the offspring of Marvel and DC Comics have brought spandex, codpieces and vulcanised rubber out of the niche-interest sex-toy trade and into the multiplex. But which superhero has the best costume?

When I was little, clotted cream was a rare treat. I remember once, when my uncle came back from Devon with two precious pots of the stuff for us, I immediately set to baking a batch of scones, which we ate warm from the oven with jam, lashings of that amazing cream and butter (to this day, I always have my scones with cream and butter). So it was with delight, many years later on a blistering hot day in Tlacotalpan, Mexico, that I came across a woman selling a basket of cakes made from clotted cream. I can still taste them as I write this.

The King of the Beats, Jack Kerouac, was renowned for laying bare his life in more than a dozen roman a clef novels, his most famous being On the Road, which documented the birth, rise and final days of an enduring counterculture.
But while larger-than-life characters such as Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Neal Cassady wandered in and out of Kerouac’s works under a variety of pseudonyms, one important figure in the writer’s life is conspicuously absent: his daughter, Jan Kerouac, who died 25 years ago this week.

                    <span>Mark, 71, and Andrew, 73, met at university in Scotland and have been together for almost 50 years. They live in London
Mark was deeply unhappy when he started at St Andrews University in Scotland in 1967. He had grown up feeling conflicted about his sexuality, and though sex between two men had been decriminalised in England and Wales that summer, it remained illegal in the rest of the UK, and attitudes towards gay people remained extremely hostile. “Sex education taught me that my feelings were abnormal. I was waiting for the phase to end,” he says. In his first week, he met Andrew, who had moved from the US to study. “We didn’t know each other well. He was on the fringes of my social group,” says Mark, 71. Andrew found Mark attractive, but had never considered a relationship with another man. “I’d been in a fraternity and had girlfriends. Being gay hadn’t really crossed my mind,” he says.
After completing his degree, Mark moved to London in 1972 and found work in the film industry. “I realised my sexuality was nothing to be ashamed of and told all my friends,” he says. Andrew, 73, spent a year in Virginia after his studies, before moving to Edinburgh to complete a PhD. By the early 70s, he too had begun to explore his sexuality, and was secretary of the Edinburgh University GaySoc. “Some friends told me that Mark had come out. They said: ‘He’s done just about everything bar putting out a personal ad to tell everyone he’s queer.’” In the autumn of 1974, he called Mark. “I was going for dinner with a mutual friend of ours, so I invited him to come along,” says Mark. “I spotted Andrew on Shaftesbury Avenue and he looked totally different. He’d shaved off the Gilbert and Sullivan sideburns he’d had at university.”

Caciocavallo is a formaggio a pasta filata, or stretched-curd cheese, and part of the family that includes mozzarella, scamorza, provolone and halloumi. To make it, cow’s milk curds are kneaded and stretched by hand in hot water until they look like a fabulously long scarf of white putty. The process at this point, by the way, is almost exactly the same as that of mozzarella, for which the lengths are squeezed into balloon-like balls and mozzate (cut). However, for caciocavallo, the stretched lengths are rolled into balls, then soaked in brine before being bound with rope in pairs, neck to neck, and hung to mature a cavallo, or straddled over …</span>

Negotiators are scheduled to meet in Kunming, China, in October for Cop15, the biggest biodiversity summit in a decade, to reach a hoped-for Paris-style agreement on preventing wildlife extinctions and the human-driven destruction of the planet’s ecosystems.

                    <span>I’m wondering if I should sell my current property, or try to keep it to bring in rental income 
Q I bought my flat with a mortgage about six years ago, scraping my way in as a first-time buyer just before any of the government’s help-to-buy schemes were available. I chose fairly low repayments and a long mortgage term, reflective of my financial circumstances at the time. Last year, I secured an amazing job with a much higher salary and it has changed my life. I’ve paid off all my other debts – apart from my student loan and mortgage – and now have savings and investments. My mortgage is a five-year fixed rate with an interest rate of 1.54% and 23 years left of the mortgage term.
I have calculated that between overpayments and reducing my mortgage term, on my current salary, I could be mortgage-free in the next five to seven years. My thinking is to reduce the balance while I am still in the fixed rate-period, and then just pay off the rest using my cash savings (since they are earning very little interest) when it moves to the standard variable rate (SVR).

Coronavirus – latest updates

The village high street in Kirkoswald, Cumbria, was once home to shops including a butcher’s, a greengrocer’s and a shoe shop. Now just one remains: a small convenience store that has became the hub of village life during the pandemic.
After its owner, the local philanthropist David Hodgkiss, died of Covid in March last year, the shop was put up for sale and was destined for closure until residents stepped in. In just six weeks they have raised nearly £200,000 to purchase and run the shop as a community business, and hope the doors could reopen in just a few weeks, staffed by volunteers from the local area.

                    <span>A unique ‘pig toilet’ and a diet of organic leftovers are part of former vet Kees Scheepens’ plans to put animal welfare and sustainability first

“Oma, hoi! Hier! Hallooo,” Dr Kees Scheepens, a Dutch farmer known as the “pig whisperer”, is calling his two oldest pigs for some apricot snacks.
Oma or “granny”, a seven-year-old sow, lives with a Berkshire boar called Borough, who’s nine, off a quiet lane in the town of Oirschot, in the south of the Netherlands, on a farm called Hemelrijken – Dutch for “the realms of heaven”.

How to listen to podcasts: everything you need to know

One year ago, the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was brought down in Bristol, prompting jubilation among protesters and calls for a wider rethink of public memorials – but also a ferocious backlash.
Gary Younge, the former Guardian columnist who is now a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, was delighted to see Colston come down – but all too aware of the controversy that would ensue, having previously found himself the subject of a Daily Mail campaign to erect a statue of the Queen Mother. He tells Anushka Asthana that the last year has highlighted the reluctance of some participants in the culture war over statues to grapple with the reality of Britain’s history. And, he argues, even figures of civil rights heroes such as Nelson Mandela and Rosa Parks misrepresent their role in bringing about social change – and underplay the crucial significance of the movements that lifted them up.

                    <span>There is growing pressure on tennis authorities and the conduct of grand slam tournaments after world No 2 Naomi Osaka withdrew from Roland Garros following a fallout over her choice not to conduct her media obligations, which she says was an effort to preserve her mental wellbeing.

The Guardian’s Tumaini Carayol says the heavy-handed statement and response from the French Open to the 23-year-old’s decision marks a ‘shameful moment for tennis’. He explains how we got here, looks back at press conference controversies in tennis and examines what could come next

                    <span>Families and farmers in New South Wales are doing everything they can to fend off a biblical incursion of rodents. Guardian Australia’s Matilda Boseley has spent months reporting on the story – and hearing the experiences of those who have been affected
When mice started breeding in large numbers in New South Wales more than six months ago, residents went to war to repel them. Now they have reached a grim acceptance of their presence – and are counting the costs of a “plague” that has seen crops ravaged and homes ruined.
Rachel Humphreys spoke to Matilda Boseley, who has been reporting on the story, about how the mice came, what damage they have caused, and how difficult it is to get rid of them. And we hear residents’ accounts of what life is like with thousands of mice underfoot, in hay bales, and even in the washing machine.

                    <span>Joe Biden has asked US intelligence services to urgently investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the possibility that it began with an accident in a laboratory. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont looks at the available evidence 
When Covid-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, much of the focus of the initial investigation fell on a seafood market that also sold exotic animals for human consumption. But in the months since, no definitive link has been proven and the precise origin story remains unsolved. 
In the intervening period numerous conspiracy theories have spread: that somehow 5G phone signals could be involved, or that the virus is a hoax. Bracketed in with these was a theory that Covid-19 may have been released (accidentally or otherwise) from a lab.
