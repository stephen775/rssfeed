The World Health Organization has approved the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use – the second Chinese vaccine to receive the WHO’s green light.
The UN health agency signed off on CoronaVac, a two-dose vaccine developed by the Beijing-based firm which is already being deployed in several countries around the world.

The Biden administration formally ended the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy that forced thousands of asylum seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while the US to process their cases. 
The administration had paused the program in January. In a memo sent to agency leaders today, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the policy did not “adequately or sustainably enhance border management.” 
A dusty soccer ball lay idle and forgotten a few days ago at an empty dwelling that had been knitted together from billowing, fraying plastic tarps tied to dead trees in the Mexican city of Matamoros.
The vignette of the abandoned shelter is expected to replicate across the makeshift migrant camp in the coming weeks, wedged between the edge of the city and the swirling Rio Grande, across the border from south-east Texas.

Normally at this time of year Hong Kong media are bustling to prepare coverage of Friday’s anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre which, before Covid restrictions hit, usually included a huge vigil in Victoria Park. The event is illegal in China but had been proudly held in Hong Kong for decades.
But this year journalists at the respected public broadcaster RTHK say they’ve been told to stand down.

Corals will bleach, penguins will lose their Antarctic ice floes, puffins around the UK coast will be unable to feed their young, and the black-headed squirrel monkey of the Amazon could be wiped out if the world fails to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
Beyond a 1.5C rise, many species will face increasing problems finding food or surviving, according to a report from WWF on the effects of climate breakdown on 12 key species across the world.

Thousands of ambulance crews in England will be given body cameras after a sharp rise in attacks on NHS staff treating patients, the government has announced. Data shows that 3,569 ambulance staff were physically assaulted by members of the public last year – 30% more than in 2016-17.
The plans come after successful trials in London and the north-east. The cameras will be given to crews in 10 ambulance trusts across the country. Medics will wear the cameras and be able to press a button to start recording if patients or the public become aggressive or abusive, and the film will be given to the police where needed.

Ten wins out of 10. Forty goals scored, three conceded. Qualification for the Euros was a pretty easy ride for Belgium, in a group with Russia and Scotland as the main opponents. Tactics haven’t changed much over the past few years. It’s easy to predict Belgium’s lineup when everybody is fit. In the 26-man squad, there are barely any newcomers.

Pupils will be offered an extra 100m hours of tuition under post-pandemic catch-up plans unveiled today – but the government faced immediate criticism of the £1.4bn programme, with its own tsar warning “more will be needed”.
After months of unprecedented school closures, £1.4bn will be spent on up to 6m sets of 15-hour tutoring courses for disadvantaged pupils as well as an expansion of an existing fund for helping 16- to 19-year-olds with subjects such as English and maths, the Department for Education (DfE) said.

                    <span>Journalist turned playwright Joseph Charlton on how the Anna Sorokin case inspired his play about identity and power, starring Emma Corrin
One night, while out with friends in London and looking for a place open late, Joseph Charlton decided to talk his way into Soho House. It wouldn’t be that difficult, he reasoned. He’d been working as a journalist and recently had a meeting at the private members’ club, so it was just a matter of using someone else’s name to gain entry. He and his friends paid their own tab, but there was a Ripley-ish thrill to accessing a place off limits to all but a few.
Charlton references Patricia Highsmith’s con artist Tom Ripley several times when discussing his play Anna X, which is part of the Re:Emerge season, created by producer Sonia Friedman, to bring new voices to the West End.

The Biden administration on Tuesday suspended oil and gas leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, reversing a drilling program approved by Donald Trump and reviving a political fight over a remote region that is home to polar bears and other wildlife – and a rich reserve of oil.
The interior department order follows a temporary moratorium on oil and gas lease activities imposed by Joe Biden on his first day in office. Biden’s 20 January executive order suggested a new environmental review was needed to address possible legal flaws in a drilling program approved by the Trump administration under a 2017 law enacted by Congress.

An off-duty firefighter fatally shot a fellow firefighter and wounded another at their small community fire station in Los Angeles county on Tuesday, before going to his nearby home, setting it on fire and apparently killing himself, authorities have said.
The gunman opened fire shortly before 11am, killing a 44-year-old fire specialist and wounding a 54-year-old firefighter at a station about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Los Angeles, according to fire chief Daryl Osby. The wounded man was in critical but stable condition at a hospital.

City look set to spend big on reshaping Pep Guardiola’s squad and have a large hole to fill following record goalscorer Agüero’s move to Barcelona. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been heavily linked with a move to the Etihad Stadium, and even named Kevin De Bruyne as his ideal team-mate, while Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland has also been touted as a possible target.

If it’s pigs heads on platters, it must be Tudors. And so it is. 1536, to be precise. Opening captions for the new Channel 5 drama Anne Boleyn, stripped across three nights, inform us that Anne has been queen for two and half years, has provided Henry VIII with one daughter, had two miscarriages and is now pregnant again. She is the most powerful woman in England, and she has just five months to live. Dum-dum-DAH!
I added the dum-dum-DAH! Anne Boleyn (the drama) takes itself too seriously for that. This is not The Tudors, this is Proper History and it delivers on all the basics. The caprice of Henry (Mark Stanley). The claustrophobia of court. The power of a misplaced word or a deliberate strike. The power struggles between Cromwell (Barry Ward) and Anne (Jodie Turner-Smith). The quiet progress of the “little mouse” Jane Seymour (Lola Petticrew). The importance of an heir. The horse-trading between countries to secure alliances, and the seven-dimensional chess being played behind the scenes.

Voting rights advocates on Tuesday excoriated Texas governor Greg Abbott’s bizarre threat to defund the state legislature after Democratic lawmakers thwarted an 11th-hour attempt to pass his priority bill that would have made it even harder for the public to cast a ballot in elections.
“At the end of the day, it’s so embarrassing that our governor can’t take a setback without throwing a tantrum about it,” Emily Eby, staff attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told the Guardian.

Police in Birmingham hunting for a group of men who chased then stabbed a 14-year-old black child to death have made six arrests and referred themselves to the police watchdog amid claims the killing was racially motivated.
West Midlands police initially said there was nothing to support a racial motive in Monday’s stabbing, despite concerns raised in the community. However, on Tuesday evening the force changed that stance, saying they were keeping an open mind as to the motive.

As Anthony Fauci, the US’s leading infectious diseases official, grappled with the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic last spring, he was pulled in many directions.
Donald Trump’s White House, which was downplaying the dangers, was demanding he portray the outbreak on their terms; the media was hungry for answers; and Fauci’s email inbox was constantly full with officials, the public and celebrities offering advice and seeking information about the world’s deadliest health crisis for a century.

Ashleigh Barty battles injury in her three-set win

Eight months ago in the soggy, cold surrounds of a rare autumn Roland Garros, there were ample doubts circling Rafael Nadal – the loudest from himself – as he began his title defence in conditions that blunted his heavy topspin. It went quite well in the end: Nadal finished the fortnight with just one set lost, and winning the first in the final, against Novak Djokovic, 6-0.
There will be no such questions this year. Even while seeded third and the possibility of a semi-final with Djokovic looming, Nadal is the heavy favourite until further notice. On Tuesday Nadal started his campaign for an absurd 14th title by defeating Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (3) in the sun to reach the second round with his 101st win at Roland Garros, to just two losses, clinching his 31st consecutive victory.

Alea iacta est. The die, after endless beard-scratching permutation, is cast. Squad chemistry has been distilled, club finals waited out, and the story cycle of Trent and the fourth-place right-back slot enshrined in the national myth kitty for centuries to come.
And so here we are with a list of names. The intangibles around England’s Euro 2020 squad have finally been unravelled, options refined, full-backs stockpiled. It is now time to cross the Rubicon into these delayed Covid Euros, and a period of high-summer crisis that will, rightly or wrongly, define Gareth Southgate’s time as England manager.

Part behind-the-scenes doc and part reiteration of Gethard’s faith in comedy, this is a vivid portrait of a peripatetic life
Chris Gethard’s new film opens with the 40-year-old performing at 9am to a pancake-guzzling audience in Buffalo, New York. Truly, the life of a touring standup is not all glamour. That’s partly the point that Half My Life is making: it finds the New Jersey man revisiting a handful of his favourite venues, ruminating on life as a mid-career comedian, and pining for his wife and baby son back home. Between the scenes of this diary-cum-documentary, footage is spliced from the shows on the tour.
It’s a diverting behind-the-scenes document of the peripatetic comic’s life – if not a particularly surprising one. We see Gethard and support act Carmen Christopher gridlocked on the interstate under lowering clouds, electric-scootering around Asbury Park, New Jersey, in the hours before showtime – then post-gig, posing for photos by the merch stall. None of it looks like the big time; Gethard jokes that he couldn’t fill an arena if he tried. But then, he began life as a tyro punk comic, and if Half My Life conjures with Gethard’s career disillusion, it also advertises his fidelity to those roots.

For all those books explaining what the British could learn about health, happiness and everything else from the Scandinavians, Japanese and French, no one seems to have done anything much on what the New Zealanders have to teach us. Perhaps the problem is in persuading them to talk openly about their achievements. Like Tim Southee said the other day: “It’s not really the Kiwi way.”
So here they are, one of the smallest cricket-playing countries, with one of the slightest budgets and the sparsest player pools, ranked first in the one-day rankings, second in Tests, third in T20s and about to play India in the first World Test Championship final.

“It is with great disappointment that I announce my withdrawal from Roland Garros,” Kvitova wrote in a statement on social media. “During my post-match press requirements on Sunday, I fell and hurt my ankle.

                    <span>G7 leaders meeting in Cornwall next week must act over the unacceptably low numbers of vaccinations available in poorer nations
During the eurozone debt crisis, the then president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, deployed a phrase that demonstrated the transformative power of strong leadership in dangerous circumstances. By vowing that he would do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro from aggressive speculation by bond markets, Mr Draghi eased the pressure and defused a crisis that, left unchecked, posed an existential threat to the European Union.
The spirit of “whatever it takes” is required this summer from richer nations, if a durable and morally just exit from the Covid-19 pandemic is to take place. As G7 leaders prepare to meet in Cornwall next weekend, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has called on Boris Johnson to match each vaccine administered in Britain with a donated dose to developing nations, where there is a desperate shortage. In a joint plea, the heads of the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization have warned that the gulf in levels of vaccination is creating a “two-track pandemic”. Some low-income countries have received less than 1% of global Covid vaccinations, while rich ones have hoovered them up.

Starmer said that after a tricky few weeks for his leadership of Labour he was hopeful that, post-Covid restrictions, a summer speaking to sceptical voters could help turn the tide. “Let me get out there, let me take the mask off. As we come out of this, it allows the political space to open up, and allow me to open up,” he told ITV’s Piers Morgan’s Life Stories.

                    <span>International courts say the archipelago belongs to Mauritius, not the UK. What is Britain waiting for?

Britain’s forced eviction of up to 2,000 Chagos Islanders from their homes on the Indian Ocean archipelago, to make way for a huge US military base on Diego Garcia, was shameful – by the admission of the UK government itself. But if the last half century has made it more willing to acknowledge its original sin, it has come no closer to addressing it seriously. The only noticeable progress in recent years was the creation of a £40m fund for the displaced islanders, of which only a tiny fraction has been spent.
Meanwhile, international opinion is inexorably moving against the UK. Last month, the council of the UN’s Universal Postal Union recommended that stamps issued by the British Indian Ocean Territory – as the UK designates the islands – should not be recognised. What on its own sounds trivial reflects the overwhelming shift to recognition of the archipelago as belonging to Mauritius, from which it was severed when the country gained independence in the 1960s, in exchange for a £4m payment. (Mauritius says it was coerced.) United Nations maps have already been redrawn. Little by little, legal decisions are having their effect.

                    <span>Piers Morgan’s interview offered a few insights into the Labour leader but not the state of the party

“Why are you doing this?” asked Piers Morgan. A good question. Why does anyone agree to do Piers Morgan’s Life Stories (ITV) unless they have an ulterior motive? Why put yourself through the ordeal of an ersatz This is Your Life therapy session with an interviewer whose eyes are firmly fixed on ratings fodder and has little concern for your mental wellbeing? So best to get the elephant out of the room first.
Keir Starmer smiled nervously and joked about this being the first time he had had an opportunity to talk to a live audience since becoming leader of the Labour party. But we all knew that was only a half-truth. The real reasons he was there were the opinion polls that showed Labour consistently behind the Tories, the recent disastrous local election results and voters saying they didn’t know much about what made Starmer tick.

“Whatever we do … ,” one Australian special forces soldier said of his service in Afghanistan, “I can tell you the Brits and the US are far, far worse.
“I’ve watched our young guys stand by and hero worship what they were doing, salivating at how the US were torturing people. You just stand there and roll your eyes and wait for it to end.”

Everton have started the search for their sixth permanent manager in five years having been stunned by Carlo Ancelotti’s sudden departure for Real Madrid.
The 61-year-old signed a three-year contract with the Spanish club on Tuesday after Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, having missed out on Massimiliano Allegri as a replacement for Zinedine Zidane, made a concerted effort to rehire the three-times Champions League-winning coach. Ancelotti informed Everton earlier in the day of his desire to leave after only 18 months.

Scotland name 17 uncapped players in 37-man summer squad

Gloucester’s final home match of the season against Bath on Saturday has been cancelled because of a Covid‑19 outbreak which threatens major disruptions to the climax of the season.
Premiership Rugby announced on Tuesday that the match had been called off because of a number of cases detected at Gloucester after symptoms had been reported on Sunday. As a result Bath are set to be awarded a 28-0 win which would significantly boost their hopes of a top-eight finish and qualification for next season’s Champions Cup, all the while denting Gloucester’s hopes.

Gaby Hinsliff (The UK’s forced adoption scandal was state-sanctioned abuse, 27 May) draws an important parallel between the adoptions forced on single mothers between the 1950s and 1970s, the Rochdale, Windrush and Grenfell scandals, and preventable Covid-19 deaths. She points to “state-sanctioned abuse” of people “dehumanised in the eyes of officialdom”.
But she seems unaware that forced adoptions have not stopped. Of about 3,500 adoptions a year, 90% are against the will of the birth family. They are hidden by a closed family court system that was found to be ridden with sexism, racism and classism by the government’s review of harm in the family courts’ treatment of domestic violence.

                    <span>Readers question why the twice-divorced prime minister was allowed to marry at Westminster Cathedral
I worked for 10 years as a Roman Catholic priest in south London and was obliged to leave the ministry when I met Clare and we decided to get married (Catholics question why Boris Johnson was able to marry in church, 30 May). Pope John Paul II refused us permission to be married in church. Is it that Boris Johnson always gets what he wants, or is it that the church’s rules defy any rational logic, or is it perhaps both?
Chris Larkman
London
• Twenty-eight years ago, my wife and I were refused a blessing in a Catholic church in Bournemouth on the grounds that I was divorced. My first marriage took place in a register office, but there was no mention of an exemption being made on the grounds that this was not a Catholic ceremony. However, as I had no children from my first marriage, the priest asked if my first wife had refused to have children, as this might be grounds for an annulment. Obviously, this could not be applied to Boris Johnson, given his fecundity. We thought it would not be a good way to start a new relationship if it were to be based on a lie, and so we declined the “offer”.

The final step out of lockdown in England is set for 21 June, when the government will remove “all legal limits on social contact” – although some social distancing and mask-wearing rules will remain.
However, a senior government minister has said that it is too early to speculate about whether this will go ahead as planned, amid concern about increasing cases of the Delta variant, first detected in India and known as B.1.617.2.

                    <span>The superproducer is married to Alicia Keys and has made hits for Jay-Z and Beyoncé – but his current role is custodian of DMX’s legacy. He explains the particular power of the late rapper
Don’t call DMX’s Exodus a “posthumous album”. Its executive producer, Swizz Beatz, is adamant about that. “I keep seeing that, and it’s so annoying that I can’t correct everybody,” he says. That description suggests a project pieced together from odds and ends to make a quick dollar, but DMX completed Exodus before he died on 9 April, aged 50, after a heart attack. It is the final pillar propping up a broad legacy: DMX was the first artist to have five albums in a row debut at No 1 in the US, and Exodus will surely also top the charts this week.
Swizz Beatz’ phone contacts is a list of musical aristocracy – he’s made key tracks for Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Busta Rhymes and more, and is married to Alicia Keys – but his name has always been tethered to DMX like no other: he produced two of his biggest hits, Party Up (Up in Here) and Ruff Ryders’ Anthem, and handled the majority of the beats on his second album Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood. “For me and him to go back in the studio like this, we had to go big,” Swizz says, speaking over Zoom. “He deserved it to be big, and he accepted it to be big. That’s the thing: you can have a big plan for someone but if they don’t have that plan for themselves, it’s just you having a plan. The key with this is that he was ready.”

The title of Hating Peter Tatchell was the brainchild of its director, Christopher Amos. When, in 2015, he first became interested in making a documentary about my 54 years of LGBTQ+ and other human rights activism, he was taken aback by the volume and ferocity of hatred against me.
So far I’ve been violently assaulted over 300 times, had 50 attacks on my flat, been the victim of half a dozen murder plots and received tens of thousands of hate messages and death threats over the last five decades, mostly from homophobes and far-right extremists. Amos envisaged a film that documented how and why my campaigns generated such extreme hatred.

Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that Glasgow will move down a level of Covid controls to level 2 from Saturday, with residents able to hug, drink alcohol indoors and meet in each other’s homes for the first time in eight months, as she slowed the easing of restrictions elsewhere across central Scotland.
Scotland’s largest city had remained in the second-toughest lockdown regime, with an additional travel ban in place, while the rest of the country’s restrictions were relaxed, after the rapid spread of the Delta variant in the southside of the city.

                    <span>Critics raise transparency fears over plan to turn all smart home devices into ‘mesh network’

Amazon customers have one week to opt out of a plan that would turn every Echo speaker and Ring security camera in the US into a shared wireless network, as part of the company’s plan to fix connection problems for its smart home devices.
The proposal, called Amazon Sidewalk, involves the company’s devices being used as a springboard to build city-wide “mesh networks” that help simplify the process of setting up new devices, keep them online even if they’re out of range of home wifi, and extend the range of tracking devices such as those made by Tile.

                    <span>The show you’ve waited 17 years for aired at last – and could you BE any more emotional? But what did you rate and what did you hate? And why did Matt LeBlanc come out on top?
Friends was a huge part of my life. Growing up, and realising I was gay but having nobody to talk to, I felt very alone and very isolated. Watching Friends got me through some really dark moments. 
I sat down to watch [the reunion], fully expecting to hate it, but was crying within minutes. All the feelings I had growing up came back. I loved seeing the cast get together and hearing how they felt on set and how they reacted when they arrived. The bond they all share is so clear and strong. I always felt as if I was a part of Friends, as silly as that may sound, but watching it definitely influenced my personality. I’m sarcastic like Chandler, a clean freak like Monica and a little bit different like Phoebe. 
Seeing them all together again just reminds you that lifelong ‘Friends’ are achievable. I just wish I could let the cast and the writers know how much it means to me. Scott, 30, Essex

The prime minister’s marriage to Carrie Symonds in Westminster Cathedral has left many Catholics with a question. If the mother church of the Catholic church in England and Wales can kill the fatted calf and welcome the twice-divorced prime minister as a prodigal son, why are so many other divorcees being turned away?
People are upset by what feels like double standards. Too often it seems church leaders are willing to bend over backwards to accommodate the powerful in ways the poorest, or those without influence, are simply not offered.

Armin Laschet, the leader of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and her potential successor as chancellor, has insisted his party’s “firewall” against the far right will remain intact, as the CDU braces itself for a strong performance by the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in Sunday’s state elections in Saxony-Anhalt.
The AfD, which first entered the German parliament in 2017, is stagnant on about 11% of the vote in polls for the national vote in September, but has shored up its influential positions in several states of the formerly socialist east.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

If Dominic Cummings is to be believed, Boris Johnson was so sceptical that Covid-19 was a threat early last year that he was willing to inject himself with the virus that causes the disease on television. But there are actual volunteers – young and healthy people – who elected to be infected with the virus, all in the name of science.
These volunteers lined up to participate in “human challenge trials”, which have long been successfully employed to develop vaccines for diseases from typhoid to cholera.

                    <span>Rigorous testing and 20 million vaccinations a day might see Beijing ready to host the Winter Olympics 2022
In March 2020, I wrote that life was returning to normal in China, but that other countries faced a longer wait. I did not imagine that this longer wait would extend until the summer of 2021. Meanwhile, China has returned to and maintained an essentially pre-Covid state – becoming a kind of parallel universe. In the last year, I have hiked in five provinces, organised a week-long in-person meeting in a tropical botanical garden involving scientists from 20 academic institutions, and attended scores of live music and dance events, featuring maskless musicians playing to packed, maskless crowds. GDP in the first quarter of this year grew 18.3%; in the EU, it fell 0.6%.
China has achieved this success due to the effectiveness of its test, trace and isolate measures. There have been numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 since last spring, varying in size from single cases to hundreds, but all of them have been ended swiftly, with modest, generally localised disruption. The key to this success has been the rapidity and rigour of the measures taken to curtail community transmission.

                    <span>The grand slams say Naomi Osaka’s decisions about press are ‘injurious’ to tennis. Perhaps they should look closer to home
Amazing, really, that the most appalling people in tennis are not the ones who applaud piously when the Wimbledon umpire tells the crowd to ensure their mobile phones are switched to silent, nor even the ones who are far more hysterically enchanted by the appearance of a pigeon on Centre Court then they ever could be by an otherworldly Roger Federer forehand.
Much more ghastly are those simply unable to deal with world No 2 Naomi Osaka announcing last week that she didn’t feel mentally up to doing press conferences at the French Open. This drew frothing anger from all the usual suspects, including the only highly paid news anchor in history so fragile that he recently stormed off air on his own show. The French Open fined Osaka for missing her first-round press conferences, and the official Roland Garros Twitter account posted (then later deleted) a collage of players doing press conferences with the leadenly pointed caption: “They understood the assignment.” On Monday, Osaka announced that she would be pulling out of the entire tournament , revealing she had had long bouts of depression since winning the US Open in 2018, and had often struggled to cope.

                    <span>Amid the BLM protests of 2020 came a call to make the music industry accountable on race – but while new initiatives are helping, real change is still slow in the UK
It is a year since two Black female music executives, Jamila Thomas of Atlantic Records and Brianna Agyemang of Platoon, called for the music industry to shut down for the day in protest following the killing of George Floyd. “Our mission is to hold the industry at large, including major corporations + their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people accountable,” wrote the women under the hashtag #theshowmustbepaused, which was shared more than 700,000 times.
On what became colloquially known as Blackout Tuesday, labels shared messages of support and suspended business, as did artists including the Rolling Stones, Rihanna, and Yoko Ono. The outpouring of support for racial justice was welcomed, but a year on, many in the industry are piling on the pressure to ensure the companies that shared black squares of solidarity fulfil their promises to change. “Were they completely sincere in it? I really can’t tell you,” says music consultant Melanie Rudder of Three Thirty Music, who has worked in the industry for more than 20 years. “I don’t feel like some were, but they had to act on it, because once you put that black square up, people were like: ‘OK, so what are you doing about this, then?’”

Everard, a 33-year-old marketing executive, went missing after leaving a friend’s house in Clapham, south London, at about 9pm on 3 March. She is believed to have walked through Clapham Common on her way home to Brixton, a journey that should have taken about 50 minutes.

                    <span>Lockdown seemed the ideal time to attempt to become one of those people who hits their deadlines while eating mindfully. Who knew my inner elephant could actually be tamed?

A hypnotherapist once explained to me at a dinner party that willpower doesn’t work. I had assumed that it was just mine that was broken. Apparently, it’s because the conscious is such a small part of the brain. Almost everything you know and have experienced has to be stashed downstairs most of the time so that if you’re at the movies, say, you can focus on what Cruella is saying, the taste of the strawberry ice-cream, the second-dateness of the situation – and the kid kicking the back of your seat. There’s no room for more.
We’ve all seen a person riding an obedient elephant, but we know that if the elephant wants to run rogue, there’s not a thing the rider can do about it. People who want to go to the gym have an inner-mental elephant that was going to go anyway. The only way to access this elephantine unconscious is to put your know-it-all rider of a conscious into a trance to shut it up. I decided that lockdown was an ideal time to align my goals with my shoddiest behaviours to see if I could become one of those people who hits their deadlines, while eating mindfully and folding their laundry.

                    <span>The chancellor has confessed his love of Emily in Paris, TV so bad even its own writers are ambivalent. But why did he namedrop Netflix when he was meant to be talking about the BBC?

Politicians should be banned from divulging their pop culture picks to the public. What purpose does it serve? Does it make them more attractive to voters? I hope not. Imagine meeting anyone whose voting criterion was how many of their favourite shows a politician liked. Imagine not immediately flicking them on the nose. You can’t. It’s impossible.
Still, at least we cannot accuse Rishi Sunak of being relatable. Because, according to an interview in the Radio Times, his favourite show is Emily in Paris. Emily in Paris, for crying out loud. What sort of monster would willingly sit through entire episodes of Emily in Paris? Nobody likes Emily in Paris. Even the show’s own writers seem ambivalent about it. The only way Emily in Paris could get anyone to like Emily in Paris was to send a load of journalists on a swanky press trip to Paris – and that move was deemed so questionable that it helped to dent the reputation of a 78-year-old awards show.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

England faces the tensest two weeks of its entire lockdown. On 14 June, the government must decide if the long-promised “freedom day” of 21 June can proceed as promised. That promise has now been plunged into doubt. A three-day surge in “cases” of the variant of Covid first detected in India may, or may not, mark the start of a third wave of the coronavirus. Boris Johnson has promised that any more lockdown will be over his dead body, but Johnson’s body has already lost more lives than the proverbial cat.
We now know, thanks to the new patron saint of whistleblowers, Dominic Cummings, the scale of government ineptitude and shambles that attended the first two lockdowns. People can now scream at ministers to make up their minds, show judgment, give a steer, keep their promises. But today the issue is not one of judgment, but of facts. We await data much as a nation awaits news of a battle in distant parts. Without news, we cannot think how to act.

People across the country have been enjoying the hot weather over the bank holiday with the heatwave to last throughout the week.
This comes as the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said it was “not impossible” that the country was in the foothills of a new wave as the government said it would be guided by data when it comes to deciding whether to lift restrictions in England on 21 June.

Work to introduce driverless tube trains has been demanded by ministers as part of an emergency funding agreement for Transport for London, with the government injecting just over £1bn to help the capital recover from the pandemic.
TfL will be obliged to produce business cases for driverless trains on the Piccadilly and Waterloo and City lines in return for the latest funding, which also comes with a requirement to make £300m of annual cuts and slash pensions.

Data released on Tuesday by the Nationwide building society showed that demand for property has pushed average house prices up 10.9% over the past year, the fastest pace for almost seven years.

Most of the UK’s bathing sites were not classified in 2020, however, because Covid-19 restrictions prevented sampling. This meant that out of 640 sites, 457 received no verdict in the rankings, compiled annually by the European Environment Agency and published on Tuesday.

A proposal to be tabled by the US president, Joe Biden, at the upcoming G7 meeting for a 15% global corporate tax rate could reap the EU €50bn (£43bn) a year, and earn the UK nearly €200m extra alone from the British multinational BP, according to research.
Should the tax rate be set higher at 25%, the lowest current rate within the seven largest world economies, the EU would earn nearly €170bn extra a year – more than 50% of current corporate tax revenue and 12% of total health spending in the bloc.

Travellers arriving on direct flights from such a country will now transit through Terminal Three, in a bid to prevent the spread of new coronavirus variants in the UK.

Tulsa massacre: act of terrorism America tried to forget

The full-page advert in a special Black History edition of USA Today presents a technicolor vision of modern-day Tulsa, with sparkling images of public parks and brightly painted murals celebrating the local Black community under the banner headline: “Tulsa Triumphs.”
“Tulsa is leading America’s journey to racial healing,” the text says, inviting visitors from across the US to sample the delights of Oklahoma’s second-largest city. The enticements include “an emotional opportunity for learning and reflection” and a “space for reconciliation … Tulsa triumphs, and you can be a part of this pilgrimage.”

Covid has unleashed the most severe setback to women’s liberation in my lifetime. While watching this happen, I have started to think we are witnessing an outbreak of disaster patriarchy.
Naomi Klein was the first to identify “disaster capitalism”, when capitalists use a disaster to impose measures they couldn’t possibly get away with in normal times, generating more profit for themselves. Disaster patriarchy is a parallel and complementary process, where men exploit a crisis to reassert control and dominance, and rapidly erase hard-earned women’s rights. All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector.

In the course of my career I’d written pieces with headlines such as “Riots are a class act”, “Let’s have an open and honest conversation about white people” and “End all immigration controls”. I might as well have drawn a target on my back. But the only time I was ever caught in the tabloids’ crosshairs was not because of my denunciations of capitalism or racism, but because of a statue – or to be more precise, the absence of one.
The story starts in the mid-19th century, when the designers of Trafalgar Square decided that there would be one huge column for Horatio Nelson and four smaller plinths for statues surrounding it. They managed to put statues on three of the plinths before running out of money, leaving the fourth one bare. A government advisory group, convened in 1999, decided that this fourth plinth should be a site for a rotating exhibition of contemporary sculpture. Responsibility for the site went to the new mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.

Thousands of women and child refugees will be abandoned if the government’s New Plan for Immigration goes ahead, according to research.
If agreed by parliament, the rules would mean that most people who would currently be accepted as refugees – meaning those confirmed to have fled war or persecution following rigorous official checks – would no longer have their rights recognised in the UK due to their method of arrival. Half of those would be women and children.

Sir Mark Rylance has called on the arts to help solve the climate crisis by telling stories that persuade people to “fall in love with nature again” and prompt government to back green policies. 
The Oscar-winning actor is starring with Sophie Okonedo in an innovative BBC Radio 4 drama set in a nature reserve that charts the challenges conservationists face in a time of rapid environmental change.

                    <span>The Games were meant to be a moment of national celebration but – with coronavirus cases rising in Japan – this summer’s postponed Olympics are the subject of recrimination and protest. Can widespread public opposition overcome huge commercial pressure to go ahead?
When Tokyo’s bid to host the Olympics succeeded eight years ago, a supportive public expected the 2020 Games to be a moment of national unity – and, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, a declaration that the country was open for business. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic forced a delay to 2021.
With the rearranged Games due to take place in less than two months the expected respite from the pandemic has not materialised, and with vaccination rates in Japan stubbornly low, polls suggest that as much as 80% of the public wants to see them postponed again or even called off. Justin McCurry, the Guardian’s Tokyo correspondent, tells Anushka Asthana why the movement to cancel the Games is facing an uphill battle in the face of vast financial pressure to go ahead.

Over the past 18 months, the pair have been working through boxes of remanent fabric and vintage finds from their studio. On 31 May, they debuted the result at Australian fashion week: two collections constructed almost entirely from dead stock, vintage pieces and other treasures that have piled up over their 16 years in business.
‘I joke that Anna is a bit of a hoarder,’ says Sales. ‘It’s ... a sentimental way of holding on to something. So if we’ve ever used something in the past and there’s been a scrap of something beaded, Anna has always put it away … kept it stashed for the right time.

The fall of 3.8% for EU member states in 2019 brought EU emissions to 24% below 1990 levels – or 26% if carbon sinks are taken into account – according to the European Environment Agency.

                    <span>Between 1991 and 2018, human activity contributed to 37% of all heat-related deaths in locations studied
More than a third of all heat-related deaths around the world between 1991 and 2018 can be attributed to human-induced global heating, research has found.
Climate breakdown has a range of effects ranging from wildfires to extreme weather. As the temperatures rise, more intense and frequent heatwaves disproportionately affect elderly people and those with underlying chronic conditions such as asthma, making them more vulnerable to disease and premature death.

Hundreds of Black-owned businesses, churches and homes were burned, leaving about 8,000 homeless and a further 800 injured

On the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, artist Bayeté Ross Smith uses archival photos to create immersive 360 scenes of these events. He finds that the underlying political and economic injustices were not only never addressed, but repeated time and again over the past century.
This story was suppressed from history books and the white perpetrators were never held accountable. And it wasn&#x27;t just Tulsa. Dozens of other racial terrorism events from 1917 to 1921 have also gone untold, even within the victims&#x27; families. 

This is part one of Red Summers, a 360 video series by artist and filmmaker Bayeté Ross Smith on the untold American history of racial terrorism from 1917 to 1921. The project is funded by Black Public Media, Eyebeam, Sundance Institute, Crux XR and the Open Society Foundations.

When Donald Trump won the US election in 2016 it upturned the assumptions of many in America about who was electable to the highest office in the land. It seemed obvious to many that Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton and yet he won a stunning victory. 
For the former Obama aide Ben Rhodes it was a moment to take stock and search for clues as to how it could have happened. He tells Anushka Asthana that his quest took him around the world to countries that had elected their own ‘strongman’ leaders. He asks what lessons can be learned to avoid another Trump-style presidency?

Although legislation around marriage has changed over the last 10 years – from the introduction of same sex marriage to civil partnerships being extended to heterosexual couples – what has remained the same is the idea that marriage is for two parties romantically involved in each other. 
However, across Europe and America, the beginnings of a trend seem to be emerging: platonic marriage. This is where two parties get married as a celebration of deep friendship, rather than romance, and where their best friend is their significant other with whom they are building a life (eg. raising children).

                    <span>Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova examines why Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, apparently diverted a Ryanair flight in order to arrest 26-year-old blogger Raman Pratasevich. Guardian Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, discusses the fallout from the action
Anushka Asthana talks to the Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova about the 26-year-old opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his 23-year-old girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. On Sunday their Ryanair flight, which was meant to be flying to Lithuania, was forced to make an emergency landing in Minsk and they were arrested. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader, told the European parliament on Wednesday that Lukashenko was “turning the country into the North Korea of Europe: non-transparent, unpredictable and dangerous”.
Anushka also talks to the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth about the international reaction to what has been called a ‘state-sponsored hijacking’. The British government has told all UK planes to cease flying over Belarus, while the EU has imposed new economic sanctions. Kremlin officials have offered only muted support over the incident.

                    <span>The Tokyo Olympics are due to begin on 23 July, but calls for the Games to be cancelled are growing due to the worsening Covid-19 situation in Japan. The Guardian&#x27;s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, looks at the current state of play. 
A recent spike in coronavirus cases has caused many prefectures to enter a state of emergency, including Tokyo. Japan has been reporting nearly 7,000 daily cases and the surge has put pressure on the country’s healthcare system, with the rollout of its vaccination programme slower than anticipated.
Organisers says tough anti-virus measures, including regular testing of athletes and a ban on overseas fans, will keep the delayed Games safe, but a new poll indicates more than 80% of Japanese people oppose hosting the Olympics this year.

Despite a Saudi-led bombing campaign that has destroyed Yemeni infrastructure and crippled its economy, the Houthis remain in control of most of the country&#x27;s population centres. 
The Guardian&#x27;s Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, explains why a new Houthi offensive could heap more misery on the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire

                    <span>Pollution, ultraviolet radiation and cigarette smoke can all cause havoc on our skin – but it doesn’t have to. Here’s how to guard your skin from everyday threats
Our skin is the body’s largest organ and works especially hard to cope with the demands of urban living, protecting your body against the impact of free radical-forming ultraviolet (UV) radiation, pollution and cigarette smoke.
