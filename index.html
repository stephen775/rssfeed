Peruvians from the Huinchiri community in Cusco region are rebuilding a 500-year-old Incan hanging bridge, made using traditional weaving techniques to string a crossing together spanning the Apurimac river far below.
The Q’eswachaka bridge has been used for over 500 years to connect communities divided by the river. But during the Covid pandemic it fell into disrepair and collapsed in March.

It has been described as “the most remarkable achievement of the Pacific island countries in the last 50 years”.
In 1982, eight, mostly minuscule Pacific island countries in whose waters much of the world’s skipjack tuna was caught got together and decided to do something to get a share of the profits, of which they received precisely nothing.

Israel has launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the first since a truce ended 11 days of cross-border fighting last month, in response to incendiary balloons launched from the Palestinian territory.
The flare-up in violence, a first test for Israel’s new government sworn in three days ago, followed a march in East Jerusalem on Tuesday by Jewish nationalists that had drawn threats of action by Hamas, the ruling militant group in Gaza.

Most of the public support a total ban on gambling adverts, while three-quarters think restrictions should be tighter than they are now, a nationwide poll has found.
Citing the survey of more than 12,000 people, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) urged the government to use its review of gambling regulation to forcibly reduce the number of ads the industry places on TV, radio and online.

A disease that causes mass die-offs in frogs has been found in captive UK populations for the first time, scientists have warned.
Severe perkinsea infection (SPI) has caused large tadpole mortality events across the US, and this is the first proof that its geographic range is spreading. Researchers also found the disease-causing microbe in wild and seemingly healthy populations in Panama, where some of the most rapid declines in frog populations globally have occurred.

Adult social care services are facing a “deluge” of requests for support from vulnerable and older people as society starts to open up after the pandemic, according to council care chiefs in England.
There has been a big increase in people needing help after their condition deteriorated while waiting to be admitted to hospital for treatment, as well as a surge in those needing support after being discharged from hospital.

Uefa vows to take action over ‘reckless and dangerous’ act

Uefa has confirmed that “several people” are being treated in the hospital for injuries caused by a protestor who parachuted into the stadium before France’s victory over Germany in their Euro 2020 game in Munich.
European football’s governing body said “law authorities will take the necessary action” for what it called a “reckless and dangerous” act. Debris fell on to the pitch and into the stands when the parachutist got tangled in wires carrying an overhead camera, while France’s head coach, Didier Deschamps, was seen ducking out of the way of a large piece of equipment near the dugout.

Scotland Yard has said it will review allegations that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked, groomed and abused women and girls in the UK.
Maxwell, 59, the former girlfriend of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges in the US over her alleged role in procuring four teenage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. She is currently in a US prison awaiting trial after proceedings were delayed until autumn.

                    <span>This shocking film follows the so-called Isis brides stuck in a refugee camp in Syria. Their stories are terrible – and their lack of remorse is palpable
You begin simply marvelling at the access. The writer and director Alba Sotorra Clua spent two years filming in the al-Roj refugee camp in north-eastern Syria to create her film about the so-called Isis brides – the women persuaded by the self-proclaimed caliphate’s propagandists to come to Syria and support their fellow Muslims by joining the terrorist group. Their various governments – Belgian, French, Dutch, German, British and more – are washing their hands of them. Now, it is left to the Kurdish people to dig deep into their already stretched emotional and physical resources and take care of them as best they can.
You soon move beyond that and are drawn into the detailed depiction The Return: Life After Isis (Sky Documentaries) provides of life in the Asayis-guarded camp for now more-or-less stateless women, who arrived in the country as potential jihadists. The film is built round lengthy face-to-face interviews with many of them – including, most pertinently for a UK audience, Shamima Begum. She became the centre of a media frenzy/tabloid witch-hunt/outbreak of legitimate public concern (delete according to taste) when she ran away from her east London home with two schoolfriends at the age of 15 to join Isis after becoming radicalised online. Four years later, she expressed a wish to return to Britain, but was – in a decision that appeared to go with public feeling but against international law and has essentially been upheld since – stripped of her citizenship.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin was deep into an explanation of why he owes so much to Duncan Ferguson, his coach at Everton who, as a player, had represented Scotland with such distinction. It has been for the technical help, all of those extra finishing drills after training, and the mental aspect, too. “He’s always been the man there that’s put his time aside to help me perfect my craft,” the England striker says. “I can do nothing but thank him for that.”
Calvert-Lewin even claimed that Ferguson would be happy for him if he scored for England against Scotland in Friday night’s much anticipated Euro 2020 fixture. So, would he dedicate the goal to him. A pause. “I probably wouldn’t do that,” Calvert-Lewin says, with a smile.

He celebrated like it was his first goal for Portugal rather than his 105th. That undampened, naked desire is what keeps Cristiano Ronaldo going and makes him continually relevant. His emphatically finished penalty polished off doubt where there had been plenty. His smoothly finished second, leaving him just three short of Ali Daei’s international goal record, re‑emphasised his ruthlessness. Hungary didn’t deserve this, but Ronaldo happens.
It marked another to his litany of records, playing and scoring in a fifth European Championship, and it will mean something to him – but it’s not the record he is really after. Daei’s high-water mark is the one he wants, along with another European title. Once, his breaking of that biggest of records in this tournament would have been treated as an inevitability. Now many doubt it, despite four goals in his last five Serie A games for Juventus, helping the outgoing champions to scrape a Champions League place.

Covid vaccinations are to become mandatory for care home staff under plans to be announced by ministers, as they consider extending the move to all NHS staff.
The controversial measure sets up a likely battle with staff in both services and could lead to the government being sued under European human rights law or equalities legislation for breaching the freedom of people who work in caring roles to decide what they put into their bodies.

Police interviewed one man on Tuesday and were seeking a second after footage circulating online showed Nick Watt, the political editor of BBC Newsnight, being followed on a street near parliament on Monday by unmasked protesters who shouted into his face.

Secretaries of state will have “greater involvement” in the recruitment of senior civil servants working in their departments under new plans outlined by the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove.
His comments on Tuesday prompted concern from one public – sector union leader that the government was threatening to undermine the impartiality of the civil service.

Daniel Morgan murder: a timeline of key events

The Metropolitan police have been described as “institutionally corrupt” and its commissioner, Cressida Dick, personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry set up to review the murder of the private detective Daniel Morgan.
The findings of an independent panel inquiring into Morgan’s killing in 1987 triggered calls from his brother, Alastair, for Dick to consider her position, and denounced the actions of Britain’s biggest police force.

The Daniel Morgan inquiry reveals no shortage of disturbing material about key elements of the Met police, the Murdoch press stable, in particular the cut-throat News of the World, and even some of the newspaper’s fiercest rivals.
Confidential police information was routinely for sale for tabloid stories – for two decades from the late 1980s – while senior Met officers entertained cosy relations with key executives, sometimes obtaining plum jobs after they retired from the force.

                    <span>Turkey, beaten by Italy, will have boisterous support in Azerbaijan but Gareth Bale says atmosphere will ‘spur us on’
“One nation, two states” is a popular saying across Azerbaijan and Turkey that sums up the ties between the countries. Those four words offer a reminder to Wales that, as if the task were not tricky enough, when they face Turkey in Baku they may as well be playing before a partisan crowd in Istanbul. Never mind that this week the Turkey flag at the entrance of the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium, Wales’ training base, was subtly removed.
Turkey is Azerbaijan’s biggest ally and relationships run deep: culturally, historically and politically. Azerbaijan received military muscle from Turkey in a brief but bitter war with Armenia over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region last year and on Tuesday the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, visited Shusha, the city at the heart of that conflict, to sign a trading and security alliance.

                    <span>Democratic unity is welcome against authoritarian might. That doesn’t mean signing up to everything on the US agenda
It is 50 years next month since Henry Kissinger embarked on the secret mission to Beijing that led to a rapprochement: “It is the conviction of President Nixon that a strong and developing People’s Republic of China poses no threat to any essential US interest,” the national security adviser assured leaders there. Half a century on, the thaw is over. The thread running through Joe Biden’s first foreign trip as president is the need for democratic alliances against growing authoritarian might, and though attention now turns to his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, the administration’s real focus has been on China. While Beijing’s record on the pandemic, trade, human rights and other specific areas has rightly raised deep concern internationally, the underlying issue is its rise, and the decline of US power.
“The US is ill and very ill indeed,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian declared in Beijing on Tuesday. Washington’s waning power was exemplified by Donald Trump, with his erratic pronouncements and conduct, veneration of autocrats and contempt for allies. Yet if Mr Biden has largely defined himself in opposition to his predecessor, he often sounds strikingly similar on China. His approach too is shaped by domestic politics: talking tough on Beijing offers some prospect of political unity in a deeply divided country, should help to ward off Republican attacks on that front, and recognises that the business world is shifting.

The killing of 37-year-old private detective Daniel Morgan in south London in 1987, and the failure to bring anyone to justice, is one of the darkest marks on the reputation of the Metropolitan police.
Thanks to his relatives, who have dedicated a large portion of their lives to discovering who killed him, who covered it up and why, a huge amount of information is now in the public domain. The report of the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel, published on Tuesday – eight years after Theresa May commissioned it – would not exist were it not for their refusal to give up and go away.

                    <span>Only Lester Piggott has won more races at the meeting as the 50-year-old continues to show the strength of his ambition
Frankie Dettori, the king of Royal Ascot, paused just moments after he won the opening race of the week and then, rightly, he lifted his left hand to pat the gleaming neck of his imperious horse. Palace Pier, the hot favourite, had not needed to prove why he is one of the highest rated horses in the world, as he cruised home to win the Queen Anne Stakes by a length and a half. But there was still a thrill in seeing a great horse, with his old master in the saddle, race so serenely across the sunlit turf as a semblance of normality returned to racing.
Dettori then brought the same hand to his lips and blew a kiss in celebration of his 74th winner at Royal Ascot. He wagged a finger and then gently touched the neck of Palace Pier again. The finger went back to his mouth and he tapped his pursed lips twice as he sent a couple more kisses into the languid summer air. Dettori had moved one victory ahead of his old rival, Pat Eddery, the 11-times champion jockey who died in 2015 at the age of 63.

                    <span>Cuts to councils and a lack of suitable homes mean that nearly half of children in care live in unregulated accommodation, writes Carolyne Willow. Plus letters from Simon Morton and Prof Mike Stein 
So the Ministry of Justice is going to raise the minimum legal age of marriage in order to protect vulnerable children (Government pledges to raise legal age of marriage to 18 in England and Wales, 11 June). My small charity, meanwhile, has had to apply for a judicial review of the Department for Education’s decision to introduce secondary legislation which states that children in care in England must always be placed in settings where they receive day-to-day care and consistent adult supervision – but only if they are aged 15 or younger.
One of the arguments the DfE seeks to rely upon is that children can marry or enter a civil partnership with parental consent from the age of 16. Yet the Children Act 1989 provides that local authorities look after children who cannot live with their families up to age 18. This latest government move takes us back decades in effectively introducing a legal leaving care age of 16.

Win was only Murray’s second since August

Three long years have passed since Andy Murray last competed in a grass court singles match in front of a loving home crowd and in that time innumerable obstacles have formed in the way of his modest goals of continuing to play the sport he loves. And so on Tuesday afternoon, as he took a rare positive step forward at the Queen’s Club by defeating Benoît Paire of France 6-3, 6-2 to reach the second round, the emotion that followed was long overdue.
After just his second ATP win since August, Murray was asked in his on-court interview how it felt to be competing again. “I love playing tennis,” he said. Then he choked up, apologising as the emotion took hold. “Obviously, competing is why you put in the hard work. The last few years I’ve not gotten to do it as much as I would like. It’s great that I’m out here and competing again.”

Call it a bonfire of the vanities. Normally the BBC likes nothing more than a chance to talk about the failings of the BBC, but it’s not so keen when others get in on the act. Especially when those others are clued-up members of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee and the subject matter is Martin Bashir. By the time the nearly four-hour marathon session was concluded, all that was left of two former director generals of the BBC was a pile of ashes on the carpet.
First up before the committee was Tony Hall, who had been director of news when Bashir’s interview with Diana, Princess of Wales was broadcast in 1995 and director general when Bashir was rehired as religious affairs editor in 2016. The committee chair, Julian Knight, didn’t waste time on niceties. No “thank you for coming”, just why had Lord Hall concluded that Bashir was a decent and honourable man in his 1996 investigation despite having uncovered evidence that documents had been forged to secure the interview?

It is billed as good for British consumers and good for business, and the first of many post-Brexit trade deals. But while hailed as a “new dawn” by Boris Johnson, the prime minister’s trade treaty with Australia has few economic benefits.
Ministers hope consumers will have more choice on the supermarket shelves, a Brexit boost in the first entirely new trade deal since leaving the EU. Tariffs will be cut on Australian products such as Jacob’s Creek and Hardys wines, as well as on beef, lamb, swimwear and confectionary. However, by the government’s own admission, the savings add up to £34m a year – little more than a pound each per household.

I saw Ned Beatty (Obituary, 14 June) in regional theatre. He had no experience in radio or television and rather looked down on them, but in many ways he fitted my idea of the character of Bobby in Deliverance. Ned was very late for his audition. He had worked himself up into a frenzy of aggression. “Are you really going to make this crap?” he said. He had already convinced himself he had lost the part. He continued to abuse me and the project. I loved his passion. I said: “Stop shouting, Ned, you got the part.”
He was a wonderful actor, and his anger was very useful. It often made the other three actors and myself fall about laughing. I loved him dearly.

Concerns have also been raised about a lack of detail on animal welfare and environmental safeguards in the agreement, the UK’s first new trade accord with another country since Brexit.

As a parent or guardian, it can be incredibly difficult (not to mention confusing) to watch a child in your care battle mental health issues, especially if it’s an issue you might not see or understand for yourself.

                    <span>Dividing money up lets you keep track of it, says financial adviser Victoria Devine, and while six may seem a lot, each has a purpose
The first step to creating a solid cashflow plan is to have the right banking structure in place. To be on top of your cashflow, you need to make sure you aren’t allowing the cost of your lifestyle to creep beyond what you can afford, and that you have a plan in place so that incoming funds seamlessly flow between accounts and expenses.
If you don’t have a plan, you are likely to lose funds to seemingly small expenses that add up significantly over time. Multiple bank accounts make you pay attention to those small things.

Australia’s resources minister, Keith Pitt, is urging oil and gas producers to turn the “spotlight” on environmental groups campaigning against an expansion of the fossil fuel industry on climate change grounds.
Pitt will use a speech to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference in Perth on Wednesday to rail against “activism” that “ignores the fact that resources development in Australia is carried out safely and responsibly and that Australia’s economy was built off the back of the resources sector”.

Fronted by a clutch of familiar names including the former BBC and Sky presenters Andrew Neil and Kirsty Gallacher, GB News, which launched on Sunday evening, is pitching itself as an alternative to the mainstream media with a focus on generating opinion and controversy, rather than original reporting.

Ivory Hecker, a reporter with Houston’s Fox News affiliate, Fox 26, was supposed to be discussing the impact of recent hot weather in the city, but instead made vague claims of suppression by Fox and revealed what seemed to be the existence of secret recordings of her co-workers.

The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has called for more information about protections for UK farmers in a new trade deal with Australia, amid fears the UK might face a potential flood of cheaper meat, and concerns about a lack of detail on animal welfare and environmental safeguards. 
The British government said UK food standards would not be relaxed, but has so far not provided details on areas such as higher levels of antibiotics used in Australian meat.

Amanda Spielman was responding to MPs’ questions following reports that some primary schools are encouraging girls as young as four to wear shorts as an undergarment so they don’t show their underwear when they do cartwheels and handstands in the playground.

It was unclear whether Mustafa bin Hashim bin Isa al-Darwish, 26, was executed for crimes committed as a minor, according to Amnesty International. The rights group said he was detained in 2015 for alleged participation in riots between 2011 and 2012.

Strictly scientifically – to use the term as she’d understand it – I have always held Gillian McKeith personally responsible for the 59-hour labour that preceded the birth of my first child. Gillian now seems to ply her trade as a Covidiot, but back in 2010, she was riding low in the 10th series of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!. Rightly ridiculed by the phoneline-voting public, Gillian was chosen to face trials night after night, from the minute she was relieved of her position in a light aircraft and forced to skydive into camp on the Sunday.
On the Tuesday evening, Gillian returned to her campmates with a mere one star, having failed to bosh the bushtucker trial menu with the same alacrity as Happy Mondays lead nutritionist Shaun Ryder. Faced with their increasingly surly hunger, Gillian retired to the quarters of the show doctor, where she was promptly discovered to have a tick. Or, if you prefer – and as comedy cliche demands – a tick was discovered to have Gillian McKeith. Either way, I laughed so much that my water broke.

Under a framework agreement signed by the four main transport unions and rail employers, voluntary redundancies will be sought throughout the railway to close the funding gap from an 80% decline in passenger revenue since the start of the pandemic.

When Jenni Olson accepts the Berlin film festival’s coveted Teddy award this month – for “embodying, living and creating queer culture” – she will join the ranks of past recipients including John Hurt, Joe Dallesandro and Tilda Swinton. “Me and Tilda, you know?” laughs the 58-year-old as she winces in the morning sunlight which is streaming into her home in Berkeley, California. With her youthful features, crisply side-parted hair and apostrophe-shaped eyes, she might have been drawn by Charles M Schulz.
“When I started my little gay film series at the University of Minnesota in 1987,” she says, “I never could’ve imagined that one of the largest film festivals in the world would recognise my work.” Along the way, she has been co-director of the San Francisco international lesbian and gay film festival as well as an influential curator, critic and archivist. She has taken her compilations of film trailers – including Homo Promo, Jodie Promo (Foster, that is) and the Jewish-themed Trailers Schmailers – to festivals around the world. Her vast collection of LGBT-themed film prints, along with the promotional materials that featured in her near-exhaustive collection The Queer Movie Poster Book, was acquired by Harvard last summer.

ECB: ‘We accept this issue shouldn’t have arisen’

England Women have been rebuffed in their request to play on a fresh wicket in their Test match against India on Wednesday and will instead have to compete on a pitch used for a men’s game last week, a situation labelled “not ideal” by the captain, Heather Knight.
England’s first Test against India for seven years will take place at Bristol on a pitch first used for Gloucestershire’s T20 Blast match against Sussex last Friday. It will also be the second consecutive home women’s Test allocated a used wicket, after England’s Ashes encounter at Taunton in 2019.

Johnson’s former race adviser accuses Tories of inflaming culture wars

Samuel Kasumu is worried about what is to come. The former race adviser to No 10 has watched, dismayed, as commentators and members of the government – who he believes should know better – engage in a bitter culture war. He warns that the consequences for the UK will be severe.
“There are some people in the government who feel like the right way to win is to pick a fight on the culture war and to exploit division,” he says. “I worry about that. It seems like people have very short memories and they’ve already forgotten Jo Cox.” Kasumu believes the man who killed the MP may have been radicalised and worked into a “frenzy” by the narratives in certain newspapers that are pushed by media commentators.

Kasumu on why he quit as No 10’s race adviser

Boris Johnson’s former race adviser has warned of another Stephen Lawrence or Jo Cox tragedy if members of the government continue to inflame the culture wars gripping parts of the nation.
Speaking publicly for the first time since he resigned two months ago, Samuel Kasumu said he feared there were some in government pursuing a strategy of exploiting division for electoral gain that could result in severe consequences for the country.

The two companies also have effective duopolies in app stores (Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store) and mobile web browsers (Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome), according to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

The 11,000 competitors at the Games, along with support staff and media, have also been told they cannot speak to a driver in an official vehicle – and will face the threat of fines, disqualification, medals being taken away and even deportation for repeated or “malicious” offences.

The national assembly passed the legislation by 157 votes to one, after MPs in the ruling Fidesz party ignored a last-minute plea by one of Europe’s leading human rights officials to abandon the plan as “an affront against the rights and identities of LGBTI persons”.

Rails will allow fans to stand safely for goal celebrations

Liverpool are to introduce 7,800 seats with safety rails at Anfield next season to reduce the risks associated with persistent standing.
The seats will be installed on a 12-month trial basis after advice from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) to six Premier League clubs on avoiding potential crowd collapses. About 1,800 seats with safety rails will be located at the back of the Kop and 6,000 in the lower tier of the Anfield Road Stand. Anfield will remain an all-seat stadium because the seats with safety rails are not considered “safe standing” areas.

The captain and five crew of Ryanair flight FR4978 from Athens to Vilnius were put under armed guard in Minsk after diverting the plane for a fake bomb threat – apparently staged to allow the Belarus government to capture an opposition journalist among the 126 passengers. Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were arrested on landing.

For more than a year, people who have wanted to get within breathing distance of Vladimir Putin have performed a ritual, two-week quarantine in Russian hotels and sanatoriums to protect the 68-year-old president from falling ill with coronavirus.
Since March 2020, powerful business people, regional governors, his pilots and medical staff, volunteers at an economic conference, and even second world war veterans have shut themselves away to meet the Kremlin leader or even stand in his general vicinity.

Over the weekend, Boris Johnson told the world we need to “create a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren”. Today he launches a trade deal which is not simply as inadequate as the pledges made by Johnson and other leaders at the G7, but is more worryingly moving us rapidly in the wrong direction.
The trade rules contained in the UK-Australia deal will be a disaster for the environment. On the one hand, it will certainly increase carbon emissions if we replace food from Britain, or our near neighbours, with food from a country on the opposite side of the world.

                    <span>Capitalism is reshaping the property market, locking younger generations out of buying somewhere to live and expecting us to be happy about it 


The year is 2070. Nobody owns a home any more; the concept of individuals possessing property has gone the way of the floppy disk. Instead, a few large corporations control all the world’s real estate and people “subscribe” to holistic housing solutions on their iPhone 78X in the same way they currently subscribe to Netflix. You can pay your monthly subscription in billionaire-backed cryptocurrency: BezosCoin, MuskCoin or ZuckCoin. If you default on your housing sub (nobody uses old-fashioned terms such as “rent” any more) you are dispatched to Mars to pay off your debt via indentured servitude in intergalactic Amazon warehouses.
I’m not saying that’s exactly how things are going to be in 50 years (the warehouses may well be on Jupiter), but, without major policy changes, it looks depressingly as though that’s the way the housing market is headed. That is thanks to a number of interconnected trends – the first of which is the proliferation of the corporate landlord. Ever since the last financial crisis, institutional investors such as private equity companies have been scooping up homes lost to foreclosure and reconfiguring the US housing market. A New York Times piece on the “$60bn housing grab by Wall Street” published last March noted that, before 2010, “institutional landlords didn’t exist in the single-family-rental market; now there are 25 to 30 of them”. The pandemic seems to have accelerated this corporate land grab. “If you sell a house these days, the buyer might be a pension fund,” the Wall Street Journal reported a couple of months ago. “Yield-chasing investors are snapping up single-family homes, competing with ordinary Americans and driving up prices.” The piece quoted a real-estate consultant who estimated that “roughly one in every five houses sold is bought by someone who never moves in”.

Actor and director Lin-Manuel Miranda has apologized for failing to adequately represent Afro-Latinos in his latest musical project, In the Heights, that is centered on New York’s Latino communities.
The Hamilton star posted a note to social media on Monday acknowledging that casting for his latest project, set in the diverse neighborhood of Washington Heights in upper Manhattan, had lapsed into colorism, broadly defined as prejudice or discrimination against darker skin tones within the same racial group.

My friends hate pasta salad. How can I convince them otherwise?
Alice, Manchester
“I hate pasta salad, too,” says Stevie Parle, the chef and restaurateur behind London pasta joint Pastaio. “I think there’s some post-traumatic stress surrounding the dish, which you should respect.” Ruth Rogers, chef-owner of the River Cafe, goes even further: “I’d rather starve than eat pasta salad,” she declares. “That’s not to say I don’t like uncooked tomato and basil on pasta, but the pasta has to be very hot.”

Every adult in England will be able to book their first Covid-19 vaccination from the end of this week, the head of the NHS has disclosed.
Sir Simon Stevens said appointment slots would be opened to everyone aged 18 and above within a few days, to help the health service “finish the job” of vaccinating the entire adult population.

                    <span>Boris Johnson announced a pause in England, but restrictions that have been eased have already created a surge in infections
The prime minister has announced that England is not yet able to remove the final public health measures that are in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and that these measures are likely to remain until 19 July. So why is this step needed, and what are the potential benefits of an additional four weeks of restrictions? Will this be enough to prevent a further wave?
The Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (first identified in India) has become the most common strain in the UK over the past few weeks and is spreading rapidly as a result of its being more transmissible than the Alpha (Kent) variant responsible for the January 2021 wave – the number of infections is doubling every seven to 10 days at present.

The sale, proceeds from which will be used to benefit initiatives that Berners-Lee and his wife, Rosemary Leith, support, is the first time the auction house’s historic artefacts division has been able to sell such a “digital-native artefact”.

The peer-reviewed study, published in Environmental Science &amp; Technology, detected what the study’s authors characterized as “high” levels of organic fluorine, an indicator of PFAS, in over half of 231 makeup and personal care samples. That includes lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, nail polish and more.

Arezzo to the Adriatic, that’s the plan. Which means crossing the Apennines, Italy’s mountainous spine.
Most hikers walk these hills in the other direction, using the Via Francigena, the ancient pilgrim path from northern Europe to Rome. But when we made this trip, we were following in the footsteps of the Risorgimento hero Giuseppe Garibaldi as he tried to march 4,000 men from Rome to Venice after the fall of the Roman Republic in July 1849.

Niamh Ní Dhomhnaill had been with her partner for almost a year when she discovered that he’d been raping her while she slept. At the time, she was 25, and a language teacher in a Dublin secondary school. Her partner, Magnus Meyer Hustveit, was Norwegian. The couple had moved in together within a few months of meeting, but things were tense. It wasn’t a happy relationship.
On that particular night, Ní Dhomhnaill had been out with Hustveit and other friends, but left early, alone, because she felt unwell. “I’d only drunk water but I’d gone to bed and was out for the count,” she says. “I didn’t hear Magnus come back, which is unusual because I’d always been a light sleeper.”

Businesses such as nightclubs will have to wait to reopen, however the current limit of 30 people at weddings, receptions and wakes has been lifted with some rules still in place.

                    <span>This year’s winners include a Japanese coal fighter, a Vietnamese protector of pangolins and a Peruvian forest defender
For more than 20 years, Kimiko Hirata has fought a long and often lonely battle against coal in Japan, but for the first time the climate activist believes the dirtiest fossil fuel is on the run, not just in her country but across the world.
Like several other winners of this year’s Goldman environmental prize, the frontline campaigner sees a shift in the political winds that has created a rare – and perhaps final – opportunity to reduce emissions and rebuild the planet’s natural life support systems.

                    <span>Production of chemical could help make recycling more attractive and tackle global plastic pollution
Plastic bottles have been converted into vanilla flavouring using genetically engineered bacteria, the first time a valuable chemical has been brewed from waste plastic.
Upcycling plastic bottles into more lucrative materials could make the recycling process far more attractive and effective. Currently plastics lose about 95% of their value as a material after a single use. Encouraging better collection and use of such waste is key to tackling the global plastic pollution problem.

                    <span>This comedy legend pushes the limits. Will his bizarre new showbiz podcast cause more trouble? He talks about the Giuliani sting, enduring ‘paedogeddon’ with Chris Morris – and David Bowie’s frozen dinners
For a quarter of a century now, Peter Baynham has been one of the writers behind Britain’s sharpest comedians and satirists, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Chris Morris and Steve Coogan. In 2005, however, he began to wonder if he had forgotten how to be funny. “I thought, ‘Whatever I had, I’ve lost it,’” says the 57-year-old. “It was gone.”
Around a decade earlier, he had joined the most original comedy team since Monty Python when the producer Armando Iannucci brought him in to co-write the television news spoof The Day Today, with a cast that included Coogan, Morris, Rebecca Front and Patrick Marber. He teamed up again with Coogan and Iannucci for the gloriously excruciating sitcom I’m Alan Partridge; Coogan later credited him directly with making the grotesque, washed-up Norfolk DJ more human and sympathetic. He also served as Morris’s partner-in-crime on the Channel 4 series Brass Eye, with its savagely funny “Paedogeddon” special, a send-up of tabloid hysteria that caused its own media outcry.

                    <span>After a year of loungewear and dressing from the waist up, these tailored but informal trousers have won over everyone from Kendall Jenner to the Duchess of Cambridge

Scrolling through the Instagram page of model and Kardashian scion Kendall Jenner, one photo, posted on 28 April, stands out. In this one, she’s not on a Vogue cover or the deck of a yacht, but crossing a New York street. And instead of a bikini or cycling shorts and a crop top, she’s wearing a pair of tailored beige trousers, cinched with a black leather belt, pleated and full in the hip, loose of leg, teamed with a white T and an oversized shirt. It’s one part Diane Keaton in Annie Hall, one part Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, one part Kennedy weekending at Martha’s Vineyard.
Two weeks later, Danielle Haim wore an identical pair of pale, full, elegantly tailored trousers on the red carpet at the Brits, just a few days after model and entrepreneur Rosie Huntington-Whiteley posed on her Instagram in the same. (Fashion sleuths point to the Igor Pant by The Row, for sale at a cool £860, as being the originator of this trend.) In the last week of May, Jennifer Lawrence was photographed in New York wearing creamy front-pleat trousers with a cropped white T-shirt on the same day that the Duchess of Cambridge, more usually a dress-wearer, wore a slightly darker pair to attend the opening of a new hospital in Kirkwall, Scotland. International travel might be virtually grounded, but there is no stopping the global spread of this look.

                    <span>They used to look like quagmires, ice rinks or dustbowls, depending on the time of year. But as big money entered football, pristine pitches became crucial to the sport’s image – and groundskeepers became stars
It was a big moment for English football talent when Real Madrid poached Paul Burgess from Arsenal in 2009. After starting his career at Blackpool FC, Burgess had arrived at the north London club in 1999, rising to prominence at the age of just 21. He excelled on the European stage during Arsenal’s Champions League campaigns in the early 2000s, and shone at Euro 2004 in Portugal. Four years later, he put in another commanding performance at the European Championships. Not long after that, Real Madrid, the most prestigious club in world football, made their sensational transfer swoop.
If you don’t remember any of this, it’s not because Burgess was a flop at Madrid. It’s because he was Arsenal’s head groundsman. Burgess’s transfer was the beginning of a Europe-wide spending spree on British turf talent. Real’s rivals Atlético snapped up Dan Gonzalez, who had impressed with his work for AFC Bournemouth. Tony Stones, who got his start looking after bowling greens in Barnsley before eventually becoming head groundsman at Wembley, was signed to oversee the French national stadium, the Stade de France. Fifa, meanwhile, signed Alan Ferguson, a Scot who had won seven Groundsman of the Year awards during 12 seasons at Ipswich Town, as their first in-house senior pitch manager.

                    <span>A demonstration against tax rises has morphed into a mass movement against the government, says Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá
An attempt by the Colombian government to introduce sweeping tax changes in response to the coronavirus crisis was met earlier this year by angry protests. Thousands of people flooded on to the streets throughout the country for four consecutive days. It was enough to prompt President Iván Duque to withdraw his tax plans, but by then it was too late to stop the protests. 
Ever since, more and more Colombians have been coming out to protest. Joe Parkin Daniels, who has been reporting on the demonstrations for the Guardian for weeks, tells Rachel Humphreys that they now encompass people from all sections of Colombian society, with a multitude of causes. One thing ever present is a fury at the growing inequality that has been exacerbated by the Covid crisis. As police have cracked down hard on the protesters, more than 50 people have died, with no end to the protests in sight.

With more than 6,000 police deployed to Cornwall for the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, there were surreal sights everywhere: armed officers on residential streets, snipers on rooftops, marine units in St Ives harbour and battleships in the sea. Many residents revelled in the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the action as world leaders and diplomats were convoyed into Carbis Bay, while others objected to the draconian restrictions which included a so-called “ring of steel” around the neighbourhood.

                    <span>Author and journalist Lawrence Wright has been writing about pandemics for decades. So when Covid-19 struck the US, he was ideally placed to report on the political response
At the beginning of 2020 the author Lawrence Wright published a novel in which he imagined a deadly virus outbreak that swept the globe.

For years, Britain’s rolling news landscape has been dominated by Sky and the BBC. On Sunday, a new rival, GB News, is entering the fray – and although its chairman and most famous face, Andrew Neil, insists that any comparisons to Fox News are idiotic, many see an echo in its plan to use outspoken presenters to discuss the most controversial issues of the day.

As the channel’s newly hired team race to be ready for their debut, Anushka Asthana asks the Guardian’s media editor, Jim Waterson, whether GB News is bound to be a participant in the so-called culture war – and whether a British audience really wants to see a radical departure from the more traditional model that dominates today.

                    <span>Omar Abu al-Ouf lost his parents, grandparents and two siblings when his building was bombed by the Israeli military last month, in a street where 43 people were killed. Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.
