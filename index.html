Tyger Drew-Honey and Kirsten Foster star in Shaun McKenna’s noirish tale of crime and punishment

But this draw leaves Sam Allardyce’s side perilously close to relegation, and they could be demoted even before they play Arsenal on Sunday if other results go against them.
“As professionals we owe it to everybody to go out and try to win every game we have left and hope that by some magic miracle and fairy dust we stay up,” said Allardyce.
