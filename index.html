                      <span>Gwyneth Hughes’s drama about women affected by draconian anti-termination laws in Northern Ireland was emotive but ultimately superficial
It was only a couple of years ago, I’d warrant, that the majority of people in Great Britain became aware of the fact that, although the 1967 Abortion Act has permitted the termination of unwanted pregnancies for the past 50-odd years, its remit never extended to Northern Ireland.

                      <span>Fulham’s race is run and, even though they have seen fine margins go against them in recent weeks, there was no hard luck story to tell this time. In truth there was little of the devastation seen at the end of recent last-minute heartbreaks, either: once a superior Burnley had scored twice before half-time to make sure of their own Premier League status it was clear, from the stands and quite possibly on the pitch, that there was no way back and Scott Parker’s players knew they were going down long before …</span>

Opinion polls for most of the past three years have shown Scotland to be evenly divided between supporters of union and independence. The Scottish parliament election result confirms this again.
