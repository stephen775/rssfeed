The shocking collapse of a 12-storey building in the Miami area last week has raised questions as to the role played by the climate crisis, and whether the severe vulnerability of south Florida to the rising seas may lead to the destabilization of further buildings in the future.
The exact cause of the disaster that befell the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside on Thursday has yet to be fully determined, although a 2018 engineering report on the structure warned of “significant cracks and breaks in the concrete” and that design flaws and deteriorating waterproofing could cause “exponential damage” via the expansion of these cracks.

                    <span>Listing likely to reveal some large individual fortunes – and Bridgepoint isn’t even in super-league of buyout firms
How lucrative is the living in the world of private equity? Prepare for a glimpse inside the machine because Bridgepoint, one such buyout firm, is taking the rare step of listing its shares in London. Back-of-the-envelope arithmetic suggests some large individual fortunes will be revealed.
Bridgepoint, with €27bn under management, is expected to be valued at roughly £2bn, though it’s unclear if that is before or after it has raised the £300m it is seeking to fund expansion. Even at £1.7bn, though, the numbers will be big because only 20% of the firm is currently owned by an outside investor, Dyal Capital. The rest is owned by the staff, and one can assume the 170 “investment professionals” will own the bulk of that. So call the average shareholding £8m among that large crew. Not bad.

Taxpayers will lose tens of billions of pounds to Covid-19 support schemes because the government dropped basic fraud checks and rolled out the programmes in haste, a parliamentary report has claimed.
The report, published by the public accounts committee (PAC), acknowledged that the government acted quickly to provide vital support to vulnerable businesses at the start of the pandemic. However, the decision to prioritise speed and financial aid meant taxpayer exposure to fraud and error was “significantly increased”.

The government’s underfunded green ambitions and “toothless” policies are failing to halt catastrophic loss of wildlife, a committee of MPs has said in a new report that finds the biodiversity crisis is still not being treated with the urgency of the climate crisis.
The UK is the most wildlife-depleted country out of the G7 nations and, despite pledges to improve the environment within a generation, properly funded policies are not in place to make this happen, according to the report from the environmental audit committee (EAC).

One year after Beijing imposed a national security law (NSL) on Hong Kong, the city has been drastically and fundamentally changed. Political opposition has been largely crushed, pro-democracy newspapers have been forced to close or self-censor, political and advocacy groups have disbanded. Thousands of residents have fled overseas.
At least 128 people have been arrested under the NSL or by its dedicated police department, including three minors, dozens of politicians, and journalists. More than half have been charged with national security offences that carry up to life in prison, and only 17 were granted bail.

Kit Harington is to star as Shakespeare’s Henry V in a modern-day staging that examines the corrupting influence of power and “leadership in a time of crisis”.
The production will be presented in February next year at a newly renovated Donmar Warehouse in London, whose artistic director, Michael Longhurst, has planned a reopening season of plays exploring the individual’s role within society. Harington, best known as Jon Snow in the TV juggernaut Game of Thrones, has already been seen in the realm of “fantasy leadership”, said Longhurst. As Henry V, he will explore “modern political power and the psychology behind that”. The show will be directed by Max Webster, whose acclaimed Life of Pi transfers to the West End later this year.

Simon Russell Beale stars in a visually impressive production of Nina Raine’s play that never quite gets off the ground
It is tempting to compare Bach &amp; Sons with Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus, as Nina Raine unpicks the difficult personality of another composer with genius in his veins who died, at least as it is portrayed here, with his musical light undimmed but as a failure in other ways.
The similarities end there. Raine presents a middle-aged Bach (Simon Russell Beale) with studiousness and teases out power battles between him and his sons Wilhelm (Douggie McMeekin) and Carl (Samuel Blenkin), but her research hangs heavily and leaves the drama often inert, speaking its ideas rather than enacting them.

Boris Johnson’s post-Covid levelling-up agenda will fail unless it addresses declining life expectancy and deteriorating social conditions in England’s poorest areas, a leading authority on public health has warned as he published figures showing the impact of the pandemic on Greater Manchester.
Sir Michael Marmot revealed the coronavirus death rate in Greater Manchester was 25% higher than the England average during the year to March, leading to “jawdropping” falls in life expectancy and widening social and health inequalities across the region over the past year.

The EU will on Wednesday say it is retreating from the threat of a trade war and confirm a “package” of arrangements to take the heat out of the bitter dispute over the sales of British sausages, secondhand cars and potted plants in Northern Ireland.

Meng, 48, was arrested on a US warrant at Vancouver airport in late 2018, and has been battling extradition to the US. Her detention infuriated the Chinese government and has helped drag relations between Beijing and Ottawa to their lowest point in years.

Yellow shirts folded. A very large topless shaven‑headed man, moobs atremble, ran uncertainly on to the pitch and sank to his knees in ecstasy. And with that a gruelling last-16 tie came to an end.

Inflation could spike this year, putting pressure on central banks to raise the cost of government borrowing to post war highs, according to the Bank of International Settlements, which warned of “daunting” issues confronting policymakers during the post-pandemic recovery.
With UK government debt spiralling to £2.2tn due to the costs of the pandemic, a jump in interest rates to levels last seen in the 1990s could more than double the cost of national borrowing.

Andy Murray has joined a chorus of players raising concerns about Wimbledon’s Centre Court surface being too slippery after Serena Williams was forced to retire during her first-round match.
Williams, a 23-time grand slam champion, appeared to twist her ankle in the fifth game of her match against the Belarusian world No 100, Aliaksandra Sasnovich, and was forced to withdraw a game later after her body buckled as she tried to return a serve.

Conor Murray has been backed to do “an amazing job” in his new role as the British &amp; Irish Lions captain as the touring side seek to overcome the untimely loss of their injured totem Alun Wyn Jones.
The England hooker Jamie George says the entire squad believe Warren Gatland has made a shrewd decision as the Lions prepare for their first provincial game on South African soil in Johannesburg this Saturday.

                    <span>Fans celebrated wildly and ghosts were laid to rest as England advanced to the Euro 2020 quarter-finals in style
Well, that was unexpected. On a grey, boisterous, increasingly wild night at Wembley Stadium England’s footballers did something new. When it comes to these grand, operatic international tournaments England shrink.
England are fearful. At best England flutter, briefly, before being broken on the wheel. Except not this time. Instead Gareth Southgate’s fine young team produced a performance of slow-burn fire to beat Germany – yes, really – 2-0 and progress to the quarter finals of Euro 2020.

                    <span>Renowned documentary-maker Ken Burns turns his attention to perhaps the most famous American writer in history, via cameos from the likes of Meryl Streep. What a treat
Those familiar with the Ken Burns style – memorably put to use to unpick such varied topics as the Vietnam war, jazz and baseball – will expect a certain standard from the renowned documentary-maker’s take on Ernest Hemingway (BBC Four). With his regular partner, Lynn Novick, Burns offers a meaty and impeccably researched look at perhaps the most famous American writer in literary history. Over six episodes, it examines the author’s life in chronological order, recruiting top-flight actors – Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels and, later, Meryl Streep as his third wife, the foreign correspondent Martha Gellhorn – to read his work and his letters, as well as letters sent to him by friends and family. It also circles the themes that came to define his work and the myths around the man that have led him to be considered, in more recent times, a controversial figure.
“He made himself the most celebrated American writer since Mark Twain,” says the narrator, just as the story begins. That “made himself” makes it plain that this is not a hagiography. This is as much about the creation of the Hemingway myth, by him and others around him, as it is the myth itself. Though as one contributor, the writer Michael Katakis, puts it, “the man is much more interesting than the myth”.

England face Ukraine in quarter-final on Saturday

Gareth Southgate hailed England’s “immense” performance in their historic 2-0 victory against Germany and urged his players to achieve something special after reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2020.
England’s manager was full of pride after his side rose to the occasion in front of 41,973 fans at Wembley, defeating one of their fiercest rivals with late goals from Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, but he does not want to see any complacency against Ukraine in Rome on Saturday.

The fugitive leader of a prominent Biafra secessionist group has been arrested and extradited to Nigeria to face trial, in a move likely to inflame separatist unrest in south-east Nigeria.
Nnamdi Kanu, a British national who has lived in south London, had been wanted by Nigerian authorities since 2015, when he was charged with terrorism offences and incitement, after broadcasts aired on Radio Biafra, a digital station he founded and ran from his home in Peckham.

They say anything can happen in football. But England’s repeated defeats against the well-oiled German machine through the years belied that particular adage. For England, however, this was the day – a 2-0 result sending Gareth Southgate’s side into the quarter-finals.
The prevailing mood as fans gathered to watch the last-16 match in the Trafalgar Square fan zone on an overcast Tuesday afternoon had ranged from quiet confidence to bold optimism, with a consensus that even with their poor record against Germany, the stars were aligning and England’s luck was about to change.

For nine years, Head of a Woman had lain hidden in the home of the self-described art lover alongside Stammer Windmill, a work by the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, also stolen during the overnight raid on 9 January 2012.

The Atkinson family watched on Tuesday as PC Benjamin Monk was sentenced after a jury found his use of a stun gun for 33 seconds, and at least two kicks to the former football star’s head while he was on the ground, had killed him.

Mannarino forced to pull out with injury after slip

Each year that Roger Federer returns to Wimbledon, the scene of eight of his grand slam titles and on the surface that has slotted so snugly into his game for two decades, he does so with the aim of winning the title once more. He undoubtedly arrived in London with similar intentions this year but he has some elementary concerns for the time being. After two knee operations and more than a year out of competition, he is still trying to rediscover his form after difficult months back on tour.
Under the Centre Court roof and against a quick-witted veteran opponent who knows his way around a grass court, those sensations did not quite arise even though he escaped. Federer reached the second round after Adrian Mannarino was forced to retire with a knee injury following a bad slip, the scoreline 6-4, 6-7(3), 3-6, 6-2 ret.

                    <span>Few would have predicted the CCP’s triumph. Now it guards its power ruthlessly
One hundred years ago, 13 young Chinese men and two Comintern representatives met secretly in Shanghai’s French Concession. Fearing discovery by police, they soon fled to nearby Jiaxing, where they had to conclude discussions on a pleasure boat.
From these unpromising beginnings sprang the world’s largest and most powerful political movement: the Chinese Communist party, now 92 million strong. Within 30 years, it would control the country. A century on, it has grown into a behemoth that controls a fifth of the world’s population and its second-largest economy, and is shaking the confidence of its superpower, the US. To detractors, as well as supporters, its feat looks truly incredible. Three decades after its patron and rival, the Soviet Union, collapsed, the CCP is looking ahead: “We must march forward towards the second centenary goal,” its leader, Xi Jinping, said as celebrations of Thursday’s official anniversary gathered pace.

The hope was that schools could stagger on for another few weeks, sending groups of children home when positive Covid tests were reported, but otherwise carrying on with their best imitation of normal, with September expected to bring an end to compulsory quarantine when a member of the same bubble tests positive. But three weeks before the holidays in most English schools, chaos has once again broken out. Cases are rising, as are closures, with official figures showing one child in 20 was out of school within the last week. Areas including the north-west are disproportionately affected, leading to serious disruption.
Once again, children are losing out. Pupils have already missed out on significant chunks of education and many simply cannot afford to miss any more. End-of-year events are also a hugely important part of the school year. They include exams, sports days and concerts, as well as graduations and other rituals. This matters.

The pay of non-executive directors (Neds) has been thrust into the spotlight by Matt Hancock’s affair and resignation after he was found to have appointed Gina Coladangelo to the role at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last year.

And for long spells, as the tension rose to near unbearable levels at a raucous and emotional Wembley, the home crowd wondered whether it would come.
Gareth Southgate had reverted to a 3-4-3, ignoring the clamour for greater fantasy and more creative players. It was the England manager sticking bravely to his principles, seeking security, the platform for the moment, and a part of the equation was patience, which was not in abundant supply inside the stadium.

Government officials emailed the British Business Bank eight times for updates on Greensill Capital’s Covid loan requests, MPs have been told, raising further questions about the failed finance firm’s influence across Whitehall.
The Bank’s head of operations told the parliamentary scrutiny committee on Tuesday that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) had asked for multiple “progress” updates on Greensill’s application to the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme.

Sweden’s speaker of parliament has asked Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the rightwing opposition’s largest party, to see whether he could rally the votes to succeed the ousted prime minister, Stefan Löfven.
Löfven announced on Monday he would resign rather than call a snap election after losing a confidence vote last week, leaving it up to the speaker to begin the search for his replacement.

Fourteen years after the divisively ambiguous series finale, the first look at new Sopranos content has arrived.
The first trailer for The Many Saints of Newark, the prequel film to the series largely considered to be the touchstone of prestige cable television, reveals a young Tony Soprano – played by the late James Gandolfini’s son Michael – developing into the steely mob boss of the future against the backdrop of the 1967 race riots in Newark, New Jersey.

It is historic not just because of its length, but also because of what it will say about Belgrade’s covert role in the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict and about the legal accountability of covert state sponsors of paramilitary groups.

England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has been harassed four times in recent months, including by anti-lockdown protesters, prompting growing concerns for his safety.
There are calls for Whitty to get police protection following the latest incidents over the weekend when he was targeted in a Westminster park on Sunday, a day after demonstrators gathered outside what they thought was his home and shouted “murderer”.

The current system of “bubbles” of pupils – who quarantine at home if one of them is found to be infected by Covid – is likely to be replaced by testing.

I read your editorial on the study of English language and literature (27 June) with astonished disbelief that anyone, let alone a major newspaper (I should have known better, of course) would at last grasp the nettle so succinctly. It is brilliant.
Since 1990, governments (and not just Michael Gove) have been determined to take over the interpretation of English teaching from teachers, thereby weakening the professional experience and voice of those teachers. As you say, “the instrumentalisation of education” has provided a model suitable for testing and measuring children, to use two Dickensian terms.

If No 10 insists that the “correct procedures” were followed in appointing Gina Coladangelo to Matt Hancock’s department (Hancock and Coladangelo: questions that need answers, 27 June) at taxpayers’ expense, I suggest the recruitment policy is in need of a drastic overhaul.
The difference between governing and campaigning seems to have become markedly blurred, but surely it would seem logical for political appointees to work from the Conservative campaign HQ, unlike those working in government departments, who are recruited by the civil service commission without grace or favour.

On a day of two satisfying England results, the first one day international sat second by way of tension, Eoin Morgan’s cricketers claiming a five-wicket victory against Sri Lanka and at one point threatening to do so before their footballing counterparts had kicked off.
As it was, the big match at Wembley was 29 minutes old when Sam Curran hit the winning runs with 91 balls to spare and 7,500 spectators drifted off to find a TV screen; theirs was clearly an enjoyable day out, the north-east sunny and the beer plentiful, but the cricket had only fleetingly been competitive.

                    <span>The mantra of party unity is wearing thin when no one knows what it is they are supposed to be unifying around


Keir Starmer is more likely than most people in Britain to be prime minister, but the odds are still stacked against him. Most opposition leaders fail to reach Downing Street. The ones who make it tend to start with more than 197 MPs. That will be Labour’s tally if, as widely expected, the party loses the Batley and Spen byelection on Thursday.
Starmer’s route to No 10 is arduous by any historical measure. He has to repair a fractured electoral coalition or discover a new one. He needs a message that works in heartland seats lost to Boris Johnson in 2019 and also in places that have been Tory since 2005 or longer, while simultaneously unseating Scottish Nationalists. He has less than three years; probably two. It would be easier to imagine him completing that mission if he wasn’t going backwards.

The government’s plans for a multibillion pound road-building scheme would breach the UK’s legal commitments to tackle the climate crisis and critically undermine the country’s standing ahead of a key summit later this year, the high court has heard.
Lawyers acting for the Transport Action Network (TAN) argued that plans for the UK’s huge £27bn road building programme – set out in its Road Investment Strategy 2 (RIS2) last year – did not take into account the government’s obligations to reach net zero emissions by 2050 or its commitments under the Paris climate agreement.

The sensuous cough-syrup purr of Scarlett Johansson’s voice is something I’ve missed in lockdown; now it’s back with a throaty vengeance in the highly enjoyable standalone episode for which her character Black Widow was well overdue. It is co-written by WandaVision creator Jac Schaeffer and directed with gusto by Cate Shortland, with touches of Terminator 2 and Mission: Impossible but undoubtedly keeping the tonal consistency of a typical MCU melodrama.
This movie gives us the backstory to Black Widow’s presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, involving an origin-myth tale of family trauma, identity crisis and sibling rivalry with a pugnacious kid sister, Yelena, entertainingly played by Florence Pugh. Yelena can’t help mocking – but also maybe envying – Black Widow’s balletic fight stance which involves absurd posing and resembles the mane-tossing antics of a woman in a shampoo advert.

Housing campaigners are warning that a widely praised initiative to get people off the streets in the long term faces “catastrophic disruption” if the chancellor Rishi Sunak does not renew funding.
Charities including Crisis, St Mungo’s and Homeless Link have written to the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the chancellor demanding the government extends finance for three pilots of Housing First in the West Midlands, Liverpool and Greater Manchester.

A new exhibition at the Maritime Museum of Barcelona seeks to tell the story of the romantic and sexual reality of men who spend their lives at sea.
El desig és tan fluid com la mar (Desire Flows Like the Sea) aims to evoke the lives of men living in isolation but at close quarters and whose intimate lives were once clandestine out of necessity because homosexuality was and, and in many places still is, considered both a sin and a capital offence.

Ministers have been accused of making a “mockery” of quarantine rules after it was announced some business executives travelling to England will be able to temporarily leave self-isolation.
Rules for those arriving from amber list countries have been changed to let visitors entering the country bringing “significant economic benefit” interrupt their up to 10-day stay at home for important business activities.

Menelik Shabazz, the director and writer who blazed a trail for black film-makers in the UK, has died. The news was confirmed to the Guardian by Shabazz’s daughter Nadia Denton, who said that the director died in Zimbabwe on Monday of diabetes-related complications. Shabazz was working on a new project, The Spirits Return, his first full-length fiction feature since his 1981 debut, Burning an Illusion.
In a statement his family said: “Menelik was a passionate film-maker and forged the way for many black film-makers … We have been touched by the tributes from those that knew him, worked with him and were inspired by his work.”

                    <span>The former chancellor’s new role is just one example of the merry-go-round of appointments at the top of arts institutions
George Osborne’s appointment as chair of the British Museum trustees has caused an understandable outcry. That the chancellor responsible for a 30% cut over the past decade to its funding should become its leader is a wild irony. And of course it wasn’t just the British Museum that suffered because of him. Osborne’s cuts, when chancellor, hurt theatres, festivals, museums, libraries – because apparently scraped-together thousands from dance companies would, laughably, help salvage public finances in the wake of the banking crisis.
The appointment has been seen, too, in the context of a government consistently in breach of the arm’s-length principle that supposedly protects the arts from direct political interference. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has weighed in on everything to what gets sung at the Last Night of the Proms to the fate of statues, issuing thinly veiled threats to English arts organisations that future funding will depend on adherence to his policy on contested heritage. If you look at the government’s desire to insert former Mail editor Paul Dacre as chair of Ofcom, the appointment of Tory donor Richard Sharp to the chairmanship of the BBC, and the scandalous vetoing of academic Aminul Hoque’s second term on the board of the National Maritime Museum, then it all adds up to a determined drive to stop the lefties having their way with culture.

Frank de Boer has left his post as Netherlands coach, having not fulfilled the criteria for his contract to be renewed, which was a place in the quarter-finals at Euro 2020.
The 51-year-old was appointed last year after Ronald Koeman left for Barcelona but despite a promising start at the tournament, in which they won all three group games, the sending-off of Matthijs de Ligt against the Czech Republic led to a 2-0 defeat at the last-16 stage.

Want to hear a weight-loss idea so ingenious it’s guaranteed to make your jaw drop by exactly 2mm? Introducing the DentalSlim Diet Control: a terrifying contraption that uses magnets cemented to your teeth to stop you opening your mouth by more than a couple of millimetres. That makes eating pretty difficult, causing you to shed weight along with your dignity. The device was developed by a team of researchers from the UK and New Zealand to “to help fight the global obesity epidemic” and is designed to be fitted by dentists. Which reaffirms all my worst suspicions about dentists.

Up to 410 million people will be living in areas less than 2 metres above sea level, and at risk from sea level rises, unless global emissions are reduced, according to a new study.
The paper, published in Nature Communications, finds that currently 267 million people worldwide live on land less than 2 metres above sea level. Using a remote sensing method called Lidar, which pulsates laser light across coastal areas to measure elevation on the Earth’s surface, the researchers predicted that by 2100, with a 1 metre sea level rise and zero population growth, that number could increase to 410 million people.

I had coffee recently with King Lear and Goneril. To be more precise, with John Tomlinson and Susan Bullock, who play these roles in a brand new production of Shakespeare’s tragedy – one to be staged at the Grange festival in Hampshire next month with a cast exclusively drawn from the world of opera. This, however, is no headline-seeking gimmick but a show that has been years in gestation.
Its director, Keith Warner, says it started with him, Tomlinson and Kim Begley (ex-RSC before turning to opera) planning a two-person version called Lear’s Shadow. Word quickly spread and a reading of the whole play was mounted in Warner’s house. The result is a full-scale production with a dream cast including not just Begley as the Fool but Thomas Allen as Gloucester, Emma Bell as Regan and Louise Alder as Cordelia.

Raab’s number was discovered by a Guardian reader using a Google search. It appears to have been online since before he became an MP in 2010, and remained after he became foreign secretary and first secretary of state – de facto deputy prime minister – in 2019.

The former education catch-up tsar has criticised the government’s recovery plan for pupils in England, calling it “feeble” and warning against what he described as a growing complacency that children will recover naturally from the impact of the pandemic.
Sir Kevan Collins, who resigned from his post last month, told MPs on the education select committee that a massive national effort was required to address the crisis in lost learning, not just “a bit of tutoring in the corner”.

The Labour MP Stella Creasy is threatening to take legal action after being told she cannot hire a locum to cover her maternity leave after the birth of her second child.
Creasy’s pre-action letter to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which regulates MPs’ pay and expenses, comes as a bill to enshrine the right of flexible working in law is introduced into the House of Commons this week.

                    <span>Yes, we must mourn our losses, but we must also party in the streets. There’s nothing ‘antisocial’ about that
We might not be close to a post-pandemic society but we are, at the very least, entering into a post-lockdown one. The challenge facing us now is how to deal with the enormous loss of life we have collectively experienced, how to even begin to move on from something that has been traumatic for so many. Lots of people have proposed some kind of formalised collective mourning, perhaps a permanent national memorial or day of remembrance. But if we need a process of collective mourning (and I think we do), we also need collective joy: a national memorial service, followed by a raucous wake.
Collective joy, whether it takes the form of carnivals, festivals, protests, nightclubs, or Scottish football fans singing “you’re just a shite Rabbie Burns” at an unwitting statue of William Shakespeare, addresses a deep human need. It has the power to cut through isolation, and make us feel part of something larger than ourselves. Despite this, it’s hardly a prominent feature of modern life. What little of it there is is often expensive and exclusive: think of the steel fences that enclose £100-day-ticket music festivals. In the pre-industrial age, on the other hand, there was a feast day, carnival or festival just about every week. According to the historian EP Thompson, “these occasions were, in an important sense, what men and women lived for.”

                    <span>Irritable bowel syndrome can rule out foodstuffs such as sugars, lactose and gluten, but it’s no barrier to getting creative for some of our favourite cooks
Are there any good low Fodmap recipes you could recommend for people with IBS?

The list of high-Fodmap (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) foods can be daunting, with certain grains and cereals (wholemeal bread, wheat pasta), legumes and pulses (red kidney beans, baked beans), lactose (milk, yoghurt), fruit (apples, peaches) and vegetables (garlic, onions, mushrooms) that cause digestive trouble typically off the menu. The diet involves swapping these high Fodmap foods (ie, short-chain carbohydrates) for low alternatives, then reintroducing them one by one over time, to discover what you can and can’t tolerate. “It’s not a forever diet,” explains Emma Hatcher, author of The Fodmap-Friendly Kitchen Cookbook. “The aim of the game for a healthy, happy gut is to try to add as many Fodmap-containing foods back into your diet.” (Of course, anyone embarking on this – or, indeed, any – diet should first speak to their GP.)

On Monday, the prime minister could be found gibbering at the camera on a factory visit, wearing not just a hard hat and a hi-vis jacket but also a white lab coat. Finally, he possesses all three Infinity Garments. I’m sure he’ll wield his power responsibly.
In fact, Johnson attempted to claim credit for removing Matt Hancock from his position as health secretary when news of his affair broke. “That’s right,” said the prime minister, “and that’s why when I saw the story on Friday we had a new secretary of state for health in on Saturday.” I mean … at least when Trump did this sort of thing he wasn’t dressed as three kids’ TV characters at once. What actually happened, you’ll recall, is that Johnson didn’t sack Hancock, and his official spokesman repeated a single line multiple times: that the prime minister had accepted Hancock’s apology, and considered the matter closed.

                    <span>What should we be scoffing if we want to help fight the climate crisis from our kitchens? The question has never been more important or confusing – here is a guide to help you get started
Was ever a word so misused as “sustainable”? “Healthy” comes close, and indeed the two are often bandied around together, in trite “good for you, good for the planet” taglines that often appear on foods which are anything but. The question of what we should eat to help combat climate change and environmental degradation has never been more important – nor so confusing. In July, the government will publish its National Food Strategy, based on a year-long independent review, which should shed some light on the matter. In the meantime, there are some foods which, with caveats, you can scoff with a clear conscience.
“Good eating starts at home, and one of the most important things we can do for the future of the planet is to minimise food miles – so our staples should be foods that can grow perfectly well in this country,” advises Patrick Holden, chief executive of the Sustainable Food Trust. Another basic principle is to do your best to understand the story behind what you’re eating – be it plant or animal: “If you know who produced your food, they are accountable to you, and more likely to care.”

There are moments when life as an astrophysicist is like hanging around at the bus stop. You wait ages for a cataclysmic cosmic event to send shock waves through the fabric of spacetime and then two come along at once.
Years after scientists began their search for quivers in spacetime anticipated by Albert Einstein, gravitational wave detectors in the US and Europe have detected the first signals from two neutron stars crashing into black holes hundreds of millions of light years away.

But as investors from Silicon Valley become interested in the technology, the pair are fighting to make sure the device is used in the right way and for the right reasons.

It’s not often that Canadians have to apologise for their country. I’ve travelled the world reporting on conflict and human rights and am always greeted positively when I say I’m Canadian. “It is a beautiful country,” I am told. “Your country cares for its citizens.” In Canada, people make sympathetic noises when I retell whatever tragic story I have been working on. “We are so lucky to live in Canada,” they say.
Canadians like the idea of a “good” country full of “good” people. There’s even a name for it: “the angel complex”. Look at all the immigrants and refugees we welcome here, goes the doctrine – we’re not like those American racists, or those European xenophobes. Canada see itself as proudly multicultural, tolerant, peace-loving and polite. A beacon of light to the world.

                    <span>From flues in statues to the Camberwell Submarine, a new book celebrates the vents, shafts and funnels that help the city breathe in all manner of disguises
A gas lamp still flickers on the corner of Carting Lane in the City of Westminster, adding a touch of Dickensian charm to this sloping alleyway around the back of the Savoy Hotel. The street used to be nicknamed Farting Lane, not in reference to flatulent diners tumbling out of the five-star establishment, but because of what was powering the streetlamp: noxious gases emanating from the sewer system down below.
The Sewer Gas Destructor Lamp, to give the ingenious device its proper patented name, was invented by Birmingham engineer Joseph Webb in 1895, and it still serves the same purpose today. As a plaque explains, it burns off residual biogas from Joseph Bazalgette’s great Victorian sewer, which runs beneath the Victoria Embankment at the bottom of the lane. It is the last surviving sewer-powered streetlamp in London, but it is one of many such curious vents, shafts and funnels scattered across the city, servicing the capital’s underground workings in all manner of unlikely disguises, now brought together in a fascinating gazetteer, titled Inventive Vents.
“We were led to the topic by Eduardo Paolozzi,” says Judy Ovens, cofounder of Our Hut, the architectural education charity behind the project. “We had always admired his robotic metal sculpture in Pimlico, but never realised it was actually designed as a ventilation shaft for an underground car park.”

                    <span>As his new show, Hairspray, leads the return to theatres, the singer talks about his mental health struggles, going back to his mining-town roots – and how the government has let down the performing arts
It is only an hour and a half before curtain-up, and if Michael Ball is feeling a rising panic at the idea of spending this time speaking to me through his iPad, rather than on his usual warmup, he is hiding it well. A trouper. It will be only the second performance of Hairspray, in which Ball plays the matriarch Edna Turnblad, and he is still on a high from opening night. “It was one of the most extraordinary nights I’ve ever had in the theatre,” he says. Despite an audience of only 1,000 – fewer than half the London Coliseum’s capacity – “they did twice the work,” Ball says. “I’ve never heard an ovation like it for the cast. They were up, and there was cheering and screaming. It’s just electric, and we needed to hear it. It’s been a long time.”
The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, was there; he was photographed with Ball – who was, in Edna’s pearls, handbag and wig, almost Thatcherite – looking delighted. “I had a nice chat with him,” says Ball, with a theatrical grimace. Theatres, and the whole ecosystem around them, have been devastated by the pandemic. “And so we’ve got to say our piece, and the most important thing I said for us would be Covid insurance for producers,” says Ball. “It’s all very well opening theatres, but if there’s nothing to put into them, what’s the point? Producers need to have confidence that they can put productions together knowing that, if they have to be cancelled, they’re covered. I was banging the gong, in a frock, so I don’t think he knew quite what hit him. But he listened.”

Ministers are expected to announce plans which will mean school pupils in England will no longer have to automatically isolate after contact with a positive Covid case. The proposals are that self-isolating will be replaced by a testing regime to prevent children from missing school.
We would like to hear from teachers and parents what they think about the plans and how it will affect them and schoolchildren.

If the lockdowns have had been challenging for everyone, spare a thought for young teens, for whom friends are like second family. Over the past year they have been unable to hang out for months, stuck at home or separated and masked-up at school, and the excitement at reuniting is palpable in Sebastian Barros’ series What’s Good. Shot after the third lockdown and a very long winter, his images show friends sharing hugs, laughs, confidences, and snacks in sunny parks and sports grounds in London. “I missed playing footy with my friends and hanging out with them,” Michael, 15, told the photographer. “Even though we still spoke on social media, it’s nothing like talking in real life.”

A study on the impacts of climate change on the Clyde area estimates about 140,000 of its poorest residents will be the worst affected by increased heatwaves, flash floods and droughts, as they are the least equipped to cope.

A question is posed in the group show Poet Slash Artist: what is poetry and what is art, and what happens when they come together? Its answers run the length and breadth of the city, in the form of outdoor artwork by such diverse poet-artists as Tracey Emin, Precious Okoyomon, Lubaina Himid, Sky Hopinka and Isaiah Hull. In addition, Cerys Matthews curates a day of spoken word and music at open-air stage Homeground (2 July), and there’s a film season at HOME.

It is a decision Fred Lopez, who took over as executive director of San Francisco Pride at the beginning of last year describes as “heartbreaking”.

                    <span>It is true that before British rule, India was starting to fall behind other parts of the world – but many of the arguments defending the Raj are based on serious misconceptions about India’s past, imperialism and history itself
The British empire in India was in effect established at the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757. The battle was swift, beginning at dawn and ending close to sunset. It was a normal monsoon day, with occasional rain in the mango groves at the town of Plassey, which is between Calcutta, where the British were based, and Murshidabad, the capital of the kingdom of Bengal. It was in those mango groves that the British forces faced the Nawab Siraj-ud-Doula’s army and convincingly defeated it.
British rule ended nearly 200 years later with Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous speech on India’s “tryst with destiny” at midnight on 14 August 1947. Two hundred years is a long time. What did the British achieve in India, and what did they fail to accomplish?

Ministers are facing demands to re-examine 85 oversight jobs across Whitehall amid questions over Conservative government appointments to the health department.
Concerns were raised after it emerged that Matt Hancock had appointed Gina Coladangelo, whom he was pictured kissing in his office in May, as a non-executive director at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) last year. She was paid £15,000 for 15 days’ work a year in a role that included scrutinising his performance as a minister.

“The endless cycle of seeing doctors and never seeing any change or improvement” is how one 43-year-old woman from the US described what it’s like to live with chronic overlapping pain conditions. Long Covid has helped highlight issues surrrounding chronic illness but many people around the world have had to cope with debilitating symptoms of chronic pain for years, often without receiving adequate professional help.
A 2011 report by the US Institute of Medicine recognised a cluster of chronic pain conditions that predominantly affect women and frequently co-occur. They were dubbed “chronic overlapping pain conditions” by the US Congress and include: vulvodynia, temporomandibular disorders, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, chronic tension-type and migraine headache and chronic low back pain.

For 10 years, Jonathan has been available on email. He receives messages as early as 6am and as late as midnight, and steadily for a 12-hour stretch every day. And right from when he first became a lawyer, the clear expectation was that he would do his best to read them as soon as they came in.
“When you get these emails on your phone, as we all do now, the pressure externally and internally to do something is huge,” Jonathan, 41, from north-west England, says.

                    <span>Boris Johnson has a new health secretary this week after the resignation of the man tasked with leading the government’s Covid response. But there are plenty of unanswered questions, says Jonathan Freedland
When Britain awoke on Friday morning to tabloid pictures of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in a ‘steamy clinch’ with a colleague, it was clear that his career hung by a thread. He had been a harsh critic of other prominent figures breaking lockdown rules, and here was what appeared to be a clear breach of his own social distancing guidelines. Later that day he was given the backing of the prime minister, who considered the matter closed. It was anything but. 
The following morning saw the release of a full CCTV version of the incident in his office, and on the airwaves there was a distinct lack of colleagues willing to support him. Later that day his resignation letter was accepted by Boris Johnson. Hancock was gone.

                    <span>On the first day of Pride month, the governor of Florida signed a law banning transgender girls from joining girls’ sports teams in schools and colleges. It was just one of 13 anti-trans bills conservative lawmakers in the US passed this year – and one of more than 110 proposed bills, many of which also target access to gender-affirming healthcare. This is by far the largest number filed in a single year in US history.
Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

                    <span>From a leadership fiasco to the ‘sausage wars’, the Democratic Unionist party’s stance on Brexit has forced it to contend with a new – perhaps even existential – set of problems. What will they mean for the region’s future?
When the Democratic Unionist party decided to support Brexit, many warned that the decision could have profound consequences for Northern Ireland’s position within the UK. Five years on, new customs arrangements and an Irish Sea border mean trade flows with the Republic of Ireland are growing – even as imports from Great Britain are slowing. And some on the unionist side fear that bit by bit, the argument for a united Ireland is gaining ground.
Now the region has found itself in the grip of a so-called ‘sausage war’ over chilled processed meats. At the same time, the DUP is about to install its third leader in a month, a crisis at the top that has exacerbated fears that the party could face electoral annihilation. Anushka Asthana speaks to the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, and the Brexit correspondent, Lisa O’Carroll, about a seismic moment for Northern Ireland – and what a political crisis for Stormont’s leading unionist party could mean for the region’s future.

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.
