A program providing federal funeral assistance for families dealing with Covid deaths has left thousands without funds – all because of issues with death certificates, Politico reports. 
More than 200,000 people have requested reimbursement of up to $9,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which was charged with the largest funeral assistance program ever handled by the agency, as part of the $2.3tn relief package passed under former president Trump. 
NEW: Americans are running into roadblocks getting FEMA funeral assistance because their family members’ death certificates don’t list Covid-19. And doctors/ medical examiners won’t amend them. https://t.co/6Y43ySI3BJ
 The hesitancy by doctors and medical examiners to change death certificates will likely delay or significantly limit Americans’ ability to receive FEMA assistance, raising questions about how the agency will ensure people get the money they are entitled to while also preventing widespread fraud. Senior officials in FEMA have long worried about the prospect of scammers submitting falsified death certificates.

A FEMA spokesperson told POLITICO that the agency’s current requirements for financial assistance amount to an ‘interim policy’”.

EU leaders triggered new economic sanctions against Belarus and punitive measures against its national airline as a dissident taken from a “hijacked” Ryanair flight was paraded on the country’s television news apparently confessing to crimes against the state.
In a summit communique swiftly agreed in Brussels on Monday night, the EU’s 27 heads of state and government condemned the forced landing of flight FR4978 in Minsk and called for the immediate release of opposition blogger Roman Protasevich and his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega.

The UK’s half-century legacy as a leading offshore oil and gas hub will be eclipsed by the North Sea’s fast-growing green energy industry within the next decade, according to new research.
An academic study by the Robert Gordon University, based in the oil industry capital of Aberdeen in Scotland, has found that by 2030 most of the UK’s offshore energy jobs will be in the low carbon energy industry.

The climate thinktank Ember said that Drax was already on track to earn £10bn in subsidies through energy bills by burning wood chips, and warned that the cost of supporting its future bioenergy plans could climb to more than the cost of subsidising Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant.

Tomic was one of 12 Australians hoping to secure main draw spot

Bernard Tomic’s French Open campaign is over with the Australian beaten in the first round of qualifying by 16-year-old Arthur Fils. Local wildcard Fils created the headlines on a rain-interrupted day at Roland Garros as he fought back from a set down so defeat the seasoned Tomic 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.
World No 213 Tomic, among 12 Australians attempting to earn a spot in the second grand slam of 2021, was one of the most high-profile players to be ousted on Monday. The mercurial 28-year-old was unable to match his efforts of February when he qualified for the Australian Open before going out in the second round.

Ministers are being urged to provide clarity after advising against all but essential travel into and out of eight areas where the Covid variant first identified in India is believed to be spreading fastest.
According to the guidance, which appears to have been updated on 21 May and is not law, journeys to and from the affected areas – Bedford, Blackburn and Darwen, Bolton, Burnley, Kirklees, Leicester, Hounslow, and North Tyneside – should be avoided “unless essential”. Exemptions include travel for work, where working from home is not possible, and education.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Children at a leading London hospital who were admitted with a rare but severe illness as a result of coronavirus infection had made a good recovery by the end of six months, although some needed ongoing physical therapy or mental health support, according to a small study.
The unusual and very serious complications of Covid experienced by a tiny minority of children caused concern last year. In April 2020, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus. It looked like Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, which usually affects the under-fives, but this was afflicting children twice that age and older. Symptoms included high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.

                    <span>Sharon Horgan’s angry baby is as biting as ever when skewering narcissistic middle-class mums. But it could make its white characters squirm a bit more

The third season of Motherland starts as it means to go on: with an “absolute nitshow”. As an official arrives to brief parents at the state primary school, every unravelling mother in the land will wish she didn’t recognise herself. The nit expert urges parents to comply with the guidelines: “Combing … shampooing … combing again,” which is only marginally less laughable than the government’s “stay alert” slogan it is satirising. But it is not too soon for the pandemic to get the Motherland treatment – if it came in a bottle, it would look, smell and perform precisely like nit shampoo.
Five taut, hilarious and occasionally problematic episodes later, Motherland ends with something less expected – an appearance by Paul, Julia’s perennially absent husband. It is a love scene of sorts, if by love scene you mean a husband and wife who can barely stand each other going to the pub. Partners who are missing in action are a cruel running joke in Motherland. Their absence is part of what makes the mums (plus Kevin) so unhinged, lonely and embittered. This season also includes Kevin’s never-before-seen wife, Jill, constantly disappearing up the loft ladder “like a chinchilla” before asking for a divorce. Never mind, says Kevin. “Intimacy takes many forms, like listening to Radio 4 together while I scrub the hob.” Ha. Also, sob.

The Bank of England will examine tightening banking regulations after the winding down of debt-laden Wyelands Bank, a lender majority-owned by troubled Liberty Steel boss Sanjeev Gupta.
Appearing before MPs on the Treasury select committee on Monday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said there could be lessons to be learned after Gupta took control of Wyelands. The bank subsequently made a series of loans to a network of companies controlled by his associates.

Pope Francis has challenged Vatican media employees to justify their continued work, asking them how many people actually consume their news in a critique of the office that costs the Holy See more than all its embassies around the world combined.
Francis visited the Dicastery for Communication, Vatican Radio and the headquarters of the Vatican’s newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano, which is marking its 160th anniversary. He appeared to use the occasion to lay down the gauntlet at a fraught financial time for the Holy See.

The spark was the News of the World’s report on his involvement in an alleged sadomasochistic orgy in 2008. Mosley sued the newspaper for breach of privacy and won, although a personal tragedy came into play when his eldest son Alexander died at the age of 39 from a cocaine overdose. Mosley believed his son might have been spared a descent into deep depression and death were it not for the furore around the newspaper’s coverage.

                    <span>Parliament seemingly likes the broadcaster more than it likes itself, which wouldn’t be hard
Over the past few days it’s been hard to avoid news and current affairs programmes in which one member of the BBC is talking to another member of the BBC about just how badly the BBC has acted over Martin Bashir’s interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, and what actions can be taken to make sure the BBC never makes the same mistakes again and how the BBC can regain the trust of the public. It’s almost become a cottage industry worthy of its own separate BBC channel.
So once the BBC stops making programmes examining its own failings, it might be surprised to find out that most MPs seem to have a higher opinion of the BBC than the BBC has of itself. Which isn’t to say they are blind to its failings. Indeed in his answer to an urgent question from Julian Knight, chair of the culture select committee, the junior culture minister John Whittingdale was at pains to spell out just how far the BBC had fallen below the standards expected of it in the way the Diana interview had been obtained, along with the subsequent cover-up and reappointment of Bashir in 2016.

A former army employee on trial for terror and explosives offences told police after his arrest that it was clear they were worried he was “the next Christchurch shooter”, a court has heard.
As well as making the reference to the man who killed 51 people during attacks at mosques in the New Zealand city in 2019, Dean Morrice claimed in police interviews that ingredients he was storing that could be used make an improvised explosive device (IED) were partly for home brewing.

                    <span>As creditors circle, plan to sell off its key aerospace supply plant comes with one major hitch
Any progress is better than none, an assessment that could apply equally to Sanjeev Gupta, his creditors at Credit Suisse and the 3,000 workers at Liberty Steel companies in the UK. Nobody, though, will be under any illusions. Monday’s restructuring announcement represents a sketch of a plan, as opposed to a proposal that can be implemented easily or quickly.
For starters, it’s not obvious who will be interested in buying the aerospace and special alloys steel business in Stocksbridge, South Yorkshire, plus downstream plants at Brinsworth and West Bromwich. Liberty can pitch the operation as “a unique, high quality business serving marquee customers” but demand from the aerospace industry has been clobbered by the pandemic. Any buyer at this point would be taking a hard-to-assess gamble on the pace of recovery in aerospace.

Biking through Toronto on a recent afternoon, Dawn Russell realized she urgently needed to pee. Six months into her pregnancy, she knew that each trip from her house would mean searching for a toilet, but the promise of city streets clear of cars proved too much of a temptation.
“The pandemic has made the world so small, and it’s taken so many things away. To also lose the ability to go for a real walk was just a freedom I was not willing to give up,” said Russell, whose name was changed for privacy reasons. “I would rather risk peeing my pants than be confined at home.”

“I’ve already told some of my teammates: ‘I hope we win just so you can feel how heavy it is; you’re going to go nuts, you won’t believe it,’” Alberto Moreno says, and then the footballer who says he competes with Santi Cazorla to see who laughs more, whose last text to goalscoring goalkeeper Alisson Becker ran “bro, miles better than Salah, Mané and Firmino”, and who vows to hide if Villarreal lose the final and David de Gea messages him, falls about again. “I reckon it weighs more than the European Cup. The European Cup is heavy, but the Uefa Cup? Woah. A seriously big chunk of steel.”
On Wednesday Villarreal face Manchester United in Gdansk. It is their first European final; it is Moreno’s fifth in seven years. It is his third in this competition alone, and with three different clubs. “I was at Sevilla and we reached a Europa League final, went to Liverpool and we reached a Europa League final, came to Villarreal and we reached a Europa League final. The next team I join, I’m putting that in the contract,” he says, grinning as he mimes signing a deal.

Two gritty audio dramas, one about homelessness and sex work, the other about county lines drug dealing, find hope in the power of female friendships
Blis-ta and Cunch are two new audio dramas with grit; their characters live in the margins and the plays explore homelessness, prostitution, crime, drug addiction and male violence. But what is marked is the power of female friendship and loyalty. In both dramas, girls have a fierce sisterliness and a strong sense of agency, even within the greater fearfulness of their lives.
This is more vividly displayed in Blis-ta (★★★★☆), a Clean Break drama written by the late Sonya Hale. Ambreen Razia, as Kat, and Ria Zmitrowicz, as Cherry, reflect the helter-skelter energy and passion of Hale’s lyrical script, which is written in urban patois and seems to relish the rhythmic beauty of words.

Tributes from across the motor racing world have been paid to Max Mosley, the former president of Formula One’s governing body, the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), who has died of cancer aged 81. Alongside F1’s former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, Mosley played a fundamental role in shaping modern F1 and motor racing as president of the FIA between 1993 and 2009.
He leaves a lasting legacy in his strident and successful push toward safety in F1, motor racing and road cars.

                    <span>The abduction of an opposition blogger from a commercial Ryanair flight sends a chilling message to dissidents. The west’s response must be swift and robust
In recent months, Europe has watched impotently from the sidelines as Alexander Lukashenko brutally reasserted his illegitimate authority over the population of Belarus. The protest movement that threatened the survival of his regime after fraudulent 2020 elections has, for the time being, been subjugated: a combination of state violence, media suppression, incarceration and torture has battered a people into temporary submission. The modest sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States have had limited effect, while deepening the dependency of “Europe’s last dictator” on Vladimir Putin’s largesse and goodwill.
Calibrating a response to state repression that will not play into Mr Putin’s hands has not been easy. But for the EU in particular, Monday’s extraordinary abduction of Roman Protasevich, an opposition journalist based in Lithuania, must be the catalyst for a stepchange in strategy. Along with his girlfriend, Mr Protasevich was abducted from Ryanair flight FR4978, which was crossing Belarusian airspace while flying from Athens to Vilnius. It appears he was followed onto the commercial flight by members of the Belarusian KGB. Passengers have reported Mr Protasevich’s panic and terror as the flight was diverted to Minsk on spurious grounds, accompanied by a MiG-29 fighter jet. The opposition movement’s main figurehead, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has said that he may face the death penalty.

                    <span>There is a funny side to the UK getting nul points in the contest at the weekend. But there’s not much humour in being friendless
It was a year of records for Eurovision, filmed in front of a reduced live audience in Rotterdam after last year’s event was cancelled. Eden Alene from Israel sang the competition’s highest-ever note. A model moon measuring six metres across and suspended above Spain’s entry was said to be the biggest-ever prop. Also on Saturday, the UK became the first nation to receive the dreaded nul points under a new voting system introduced in 2016, where the splitting of votes between juries and viewers was thought to make it almost impossible for a song to plumb such depths of unpopularity. Ooh la la, as the French contestant Barbara Pravi (one of a minority of competitors to sing in a language other than English) might have said.
Ms Pravi came second behind Italy’s Måneskin, a band that was caught up in another drama. Damiano David, the singer for the triumphant Roman rockers, agreed to take a drug test after he was caught on camera appearing to snort something off a table. The test having come back negative, his band kept their title. Down at the bottom of the scoreboard, there was even less room for manoeuvre. Britain’s James Newman took the rejection of his lacklustre tune, Embers, with good grace. In a contest that revels in being over the top, there is perhaps something fitting about such a spectacular defeat.

Responding to a Commons urgent question, after the BBC said it had also begun a new inquiry into the circumstances of Martin Bashir’s 1995 interview, the culture minister John Whittingdale said last week’s report into the affair made for “shocking reading”.

A gas explosion that killed a two-year-old boy was caused by a cut gas pipe inside a neighbouring house, police have said.
George Arthur Hinds died in the blast in Heysham, Lancashire, on 16 May. The police inquiry into the incident is ongoing but a Lancashire constabulary spokesperson confirmed it was now being classed as a criminal investigation.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The government failed to act on warnings that there would be a shortage of PPE equipment in the weeks before the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a major medical equipment supplier has told MPs.
At a hearing of the public accounts committee, the head of one of the UK’s largest PPE firms also criticised the government’s “VIP lane”, saying he was unaware it existed.

                    <span>The Kent all-rounder is beloved by many followers of English cricket but also unfairly cited by others as a symptom of its ills
As with so much else in his life, fame came late in the day to Darren Stevens. The Kent all-rounder’s extraordinary innings of 190 against Glamorgan last Friday created a very modern sort of buzz, one that has really been possible only in recent years. For decades, an innings like Stevens’s would have existed largely in the imagination: a blur of numbers on a screen and two columns in the newspaper, rather than an actual lived memory. Now, via social media and the miracle of the YouTube livestream – hey, psst, stop what you’re doing and watch this – it can live in plain sight.
And what an innings it was: remarkable not so much for its technical excellence (he was dropped three times) but for its sheer, sleeves-up, bollocks-to-you audacity. Michael Neser, a 90mph Australian international seamer, is smashed over his head. Andrew Salter, a lovely classical off-spinner, has resigned himself to being hit for six before he even delivers the ball. At the other end, Miguel Cummins shares a ninth-wicket partnership of 166 in which his own contribution is one.

Priti Patel has been accused in parliament of seeking to block or redact an independent report into the murder of a private detective as part of a potential “cover up” to protect friends in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.
Labour MP Chris Bryant, who secured an urgent question into the home secretary’s decision to vet the report into Daniel Morgan’s 1987 killing, said there were concerns that “people with very close friends in News International might want to delay or even prevent this publication”.

                    <span>Italy’s worst cable car disaster in more than 20 years has left people questioning what went wrong
Two Sundays before fourteen people fell to their deaths in Italy’s worst cable car disaster in more than 20 years, hundreds of marathon runners had raced up a mountain path behind Lake Maggiore. After reaching the summit of Monte Mottarone, they made their way back down in cable cars, departing every 20 minutes for the return to the lakeside resort of Stresa below.
“It’s difficult to believe that just two weeks ago so many people – maybe 800 – ran up the mountain and all came down safely by cable car,” said Rinaldo Piraccini, who was sitting outside L’Idrovolante, a bar and restaurant next to the entrance of the funicular, with his friend Daniele Sacchi on Monday afternoon.

                    <span>When Berlin’s cafe terraces reopened at the weekend, our writer joined the ‘amazing’ scenes in Kreuzberg, where people gathered to celebrate the relaxation of lockdown – even in the rain
It’s Friday night in Berlin and I’m roaming along Kreuzberg’s Oranienstrasse with a friend. We can hardly believe the palpable buzz and sight of dining tables stacked with wine coolers, large white plates laden with schnitzel and asparagus, and people mingling on pavements that have, since November 2020, been almost supernaturally quiet.
It all happened quite suddenly. One minute I was at home, feeling uncertain about exploring the city over the Great Reopening Weekend, and the next – after an excited phone call from a friend – I was on a U-Bahn to Kottbusser Tor, umbrella in hand to fend off the ominous weather, ready to enjoy the experience.

OnlyFans – run by Tim Stokely, his brother Tom and his father Guy, a former investment banker – handled £1.7bn of sales during the year to November 2020, up 615% on the previous 12 months.

                    <span>Readers respond to the government’s plans to restructure the railway industry
I do not agree with much of what Simon Jenkins says on the plans for a part-nationalised, part-privatised rail network (There’s nothing ‘great’ about this new British Railways revamp, 20 May), but he is right that the model being proposed is wrong. There used to be a simple maxim that the reason for involving the private sector in public services was to transfer risk. Taking risks was something the private sector was supposed to be good at. It targets investments to make the service attractive. It then sells that service to maximise profits. Getting the decisions right is the difficult thing – that is the risk it takes. To do this, it needs to be allowed to make key decisions, such as how big the service is and how often it will run, to match how many it believes it can sell. The more it sells, the better the profits. Simple.
But the new Great British Railways model takes these risks away from the private sector. The “how big” and “how often” decisions will be taken by the government. The private companies will just get paid for running the trains. The only variable in the private sector’s control will be costs. The decision, therefore, will no longer be “how many do we sell?”, as that will be fixed by the government, but “how do we deliver this more cheaply?”. To maximise profits, the companies will have just one aim: to reduce costs. And we are to believe Grant Shapps when he says that this will result in a better service?

Discussion of the racism of ESN – “educationally subnormal” – schools (‘Black kids were written off’: the scandal of the children sent to ‘dustbin schools’, 19 May) stirs up deeply uncomfortable memories of my own racism as a teacher in a mainstream school.
For three years in the early 1970s I taught art in an inner London girls’ comprehensive. I had no teacher training – having a degree in your subject licensed you to teach it. Two weeks before I left, I found myself dreading a class with two particularly disruptive black girls. At the last minute I cobbled together a still life and prayed that would keep them quiet. And it did. The drawings that the two disruptive girls did were well observed, delicate and powerful; I can still picture one of them in my mind’s eye, nearly 50 years later.

                    <span>He was a demonic emperor who stabbed citizens at random and let Rome burn. Or was he? We go behind the scenes at a new show exploding myths about the ancient world’s favourite baddie
Nero comes with a lurid reputation. “The main thing we know about him is his infamy,” says Thorsten Opper, curator of the first British exhibition devoted to the Roman emperor. “The glutton, the profligate, the matricide, the megalomaniac.” Also, the pyromaniac: famously, Nero “fiddled while Rome burned”, or at least strummed his kithara to one of his own compositions, The Fall of Troy, while a fire, supposedly begun by him, destroyed three of Rome’s 14 districts and seriously damaged seven.
His afterlife on the page and screen is certainly arresting. Nero inspired some of the greatest Renaissance and baroque operas, notably Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea and Handel’s Agrippina, which chart the emperor’s adulterous love for Poppaea, who became his second wife. In the epic 1951 movie Quo Vadis, Peter Ustinov played Nero as entirely unhinged: a mincing, purple-swathed toddler in a man’s body. Christopher Biggins took him on in I, Claudius, the classic BBC adaptation of Robert Graves’s novel, and made him power-hungry, baby-faced and quite, quite mad.

Coronavirus – latest updates

New data released over the weekend added to concerns about the ability of the Covid variant first detected in India – B.1.617.2 – to spread in the UK, but brought relief by suggesting that the vaccines still offer considerable protection against this growing threat.
With many still not eligible for vaccines or partially vaccinated, what does this mean for the government’s roadmap out of restrictions?

Last summer saw Orlando Bloom joined celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and Demi Lovato in having the image of his beloved pet inked on his skin. Now, with tattoo parlours reopened and many of us having taken on a new pet during the pandemic, more may be likely to follow in their footsteps.
With this in mind, we’d love to hear about – and see pictures of – your pet tattoos. Perhaps you decided to have a cherished cat memorialised forever with a tribute tattoo after they passed away? Or maybe it’s your pandemic puppy that’s inspired a new inking? Either way, please do tell us about your tattoo and share an image of the design below.

“I am not concerned with whether or not fat people can change their bodies through self-discipline and ‘choices’. Pretty much all of them have tried already. A couple of them have succeeded. Whatever. My question is, what if they try and try and try and still fail? What if they are still fat? What if they are fat for ever? What do you do with them then? Do you really want millions of teenage girls to feel like they’re trapped in unsightly lard prisons that are ruining their lives, and on top of that it’s because of their own moral failure, and on top of that they are ruining America with the terribly expensive diabetes that they don’t even have yet? You know what’s shameful? A complete lack of empathy.”

It may seem typical after a shock sporting outcome for the champion to insist he or she always had belief they could defy the odds. In the case of Phil Mickelson, the level of continued dedication to his profession makes earlier confidence entirely believable.
At the age of 50 years, 11 months and seven days, Mickelson became the oldest champion in major history amid moving scenes at the US PGA Championship. What came after was not so much an explanation of how Mickelson reached the finest achievement of his career but insistence of how he never believed his time on golf’s frontline was over.

Israeli police have shot dead an attacker who stabbed an Israeli soldier and civilian in Jerusalem. The attack on Monday came with the city still on edge after 11 days of war, and as opposition parties restarted efforts to oust the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, with a unity coalition.
It was the latest reminder of how volatile the situation is, barely two weeks after protests and clashes with police escalated into an exchange of rockets and missiles that killed more than 250 people, the vast majority of them Palestinians living in Gaza.

Police insist Johnson, who came to prominence last year as protests for racial justice sprung up across Britain, was not specifically targeted, nor was the shooting linked to her activism. It is believed the mother-of-three was most likely an unintended victim.

A blind man has had his sight partly restored after a form of gene therapy that uses pulses of light to control the activity of nerve cells – the first successful demonstration of so-called optogenetic therapy in humans.
The 58-year-old man, from Brittany in northern France, was said to be “very excited” after regaining the ability to recognise, count, locate and touch different objects with the treated eye while wearing a pair of light-stimulating goggles, having lost his sight after being diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa almost 40 years ago.

                    <span>After two fires and an £18m makeover, this redbrick mill has been reborn as a shrine to Derby’s astonishing manufacturing prowess, where everything from clocks and clogs to telephones and tights were made
A seven-tonne Rolls-Royce jet engine hangs in the lofty glass atrium of Derby’s new Museum of Making, suspended above a wall of objects that cascade down the stairs towards the entrance, as if propelled by the mighty turbofan of the engine. It is a junk-shop tsunami of clogs and clocks, spoons and street signs, telephones and tights, harnesses and horsetails, with one thing in common: they were all made in Derby.
There might be no better place to tell the story of manufacturing than this Midlands city, and specifically this building: a redbrick mill on the River Derwent that was the first fully mechanised factory in the world when it opened in 1721. Built by industrialist John Lombe for spinning silk, it has produced everything from cough sweets and skin ointment to fly paper and ice cream powder over the last 300 years – and burned down twice in the process. After an £18m makeover, it has been reborn as a shrine to all of these things and more, as well as an active site of production, in a radical new concept for what a museum can be.

Simukai Chigudu is associate professor of African politics at the University of Oxford

Anger is a potent, if volatile, political force. It can be channelled toward many ends. It’s often dismissed as counterproductive, but Audre Lorde, the African American writer and civil rights activist, reminds us that anger can be a powerful source of energy. It can serve progress and change, it can be liberating and clarifying.
I remember so viscerally my own anger this time last year as I screamed Black Lives Matter in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. And I was not alone. The world witnessed a prolonged outpouring of rage. Global protests with emotionally charged testimonies and determined calls for justice abounded. These protests soon extended beyond the immediate circumstances of Floyd’s death at the knee of Derek Chauvin to challenging an array of institutions that are built on or propagate anti-Black racism. Anger had made it abundantly clear that, despite all the promises of liberal democracy, western society still has a problem with race.

The latest photo showed Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, a daughter of the ruler of Dubai, looking at the camera blankly next to a clairvoyant at a coffee table.

                    <span>It’s one of the most widely eaten staples in the world, yet little known in the UK. Here’s why this healthy, sustainable food should be on everyone’s shopping list
It may be an issue with branding, concedes Roxana Jullapat. Sorghum sounds odd – and not especially delicious. “I do wonder: why did quinoa get a chance and sorghum didn’t?” says Jullapat, who runs the Los Angeles bakery Friends &amp; Family. She is also the author of Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution. It is a cookbook, but also a love letter to whole grains and a manifesto for weaning people off wheat. Although Jullapat covers other “ancient” grains – including rye, oat and barley – in the book, sorghum is probably the least familiar to most readers in the UK.
Originating in Africa, where it is eaten widely, sorghum made its way to the southern US, probably with enslaved people. Later, it became an important crop – particularly for the sweet sorghum molasses made from it – to African American families in the south; the culinary historian Michael W Twitty has talked about reclaiming sorghum. It is popular in the Middle East and east Asia, too. It is a very weather-resistant crop and can be grown in a densely populated way, which makes it valuable in terms of food security.

One vice-chancellor said the comprehensive spending review expected in the autumn was “looking horrific” for universities, with Downing Street and the Treasury competing over what to include in the government’s policy paper on funding, which is due to be published within the next two months.

China has vehemently denied a Wall Street Journal report citing US intelligence materials that said several members of staff at a key virus laboratory in Wuhan had fallen ill shortly before the first patient with Covid-like symptoms was recorded in the city on 8 December 2019.
Foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said it was “completely untrue” that three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) became sick in autumn 2019. The report, based on “previously undisclosed” US intelligence, said the said the lab workers staff had become sick “with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illness”.

I’d had quite a few jobs to pay the bills while writing music – including working in the front kiosk at Leeds magistrates’ court, collecting fines and doing a bit of admin – and I was helping out at Flexible Response Studios when an engineer introduced me to my future bandmates, John Beck and John Hughes.

                    <span>Political strategists have always sought to put us all into boxes – because if we’re railing against one another we’re not directing our anger at the government
A fresh flurry of indignation has greeted the latest “slice, dice and present to collective outrage” demographic creation: the “geriatric millennial”, born in the early 80s. Apparently, their ease in shifting between analogue and digital worlds mean every workplace should be run by one, but that hasn’t stopped many, understandably, protesting about the terminology.
An impressive – or alarming – amount of creative energy is expended in describing the simple fact that people are different ages. Marketing executives and political strategists used the likes of Mondeo Man or Aldi Mum, daft as they were, to describe a set of aspirations or attributes susceptible to targeted seduction.

Police in Catalonia are investigating the death of a man who is thought to have become trapped inside a large dinosaur statue while trying to retrieve his mobile phone.
Officers were called to the statue in Santa Coloma de Gramenet, a satellite town of Barcelona, after a man and his son noticed something inside the papier-mache stegosaurus on Saturday afternoon.

“It was my first experience of racism, and I didn’t really know how to respond,” said the Los Angeles girl, recounting the conversation in fourth grade in March 2020, just before California shut down. She told him she was Chinese – and he backed away.

“Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” a fellow passenger described him as saying. “We must, we have no choice,” the attendant reportedly replied.

                    <span>By selling my songs to fans directly, I’m getting agency back in a world where music is undervalued by streaming companies and the UK government
I’ve come to realise that the old models of making music are becoming defunct. I spent 10 years on a major label, and it was sometimes hard: I was signed to EMI by the two guys who originally signed Radiohead and Kate Bush, who were excited that I dabbled in lots of different art forms. However, they left and I was given the man who signed Lily Allen and Kylie, and after that I felt tolerated rather than supported.
I didn’t want to “go pop” or compromise my vision. Many of the artists I loved – David Bowie, Kate Bush, the Beatles – had been associated with EMI, and others such as Björk had also proved that it is possible to have commercial success and be unique and artistic. Had I been working in the 1960s or 70s I would have ridden a wave of avant garde work into the mainstream. I had three Top 10 albums, and Brit, Ivor Novello and Mercury nominations, but the whole time I was on a major label I felt like I was negotiating my art school philosophy of DIY.

                    <span>Without any obvious ‘next of kin’, I turned to a group of female friends to help. It proved revelatory
At the start of 2019, I found myself in an A&amp;E in east London with a high fever and struggling to breathe. But the symptoms weren’t my only problem. The woman behind the hospital check-in desk asked for my next of kin. Suddenly, I realised I had no name to give her. My mum, who’d raised me without a partner, was fighting for her life after a transplant, part of her gruelling cancer treatment. I was also single for the first time in a long time. I blinked back tears as I sent a message to a group of friends asking whether it was OK for me to give one of their contact details.
This wasn’t just any group of friends. As my mum was being prepped for her risky transplant a couple of months before, I had the bleak realisation that I might soon be very alone in the world. My relationship was breaking down, soon to be over, and my mum was no longer able to be a parent. I’d stumbled across a vlog on YouTube about something called a “women’s circle”. It sounded somewhat hippyish, but also comforting.

“Can our president keep us safe when we travel to any part of this country?” said Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, months before the former military dictator won the Nigerian presidency on a wave of mass anger at jihadist violence and corruption. “Is your life better today than it was six years ago?”
Halfway through his second term, the same questions are being levelled at him. As an insurgency in the north-east has persisted – and grown in recent years – security crises have proliferated around the country. Criticism has mounted against his administration, including from within his own party.

When Tim, 68, landed a role in The Real Long John Silver at the Battersea Arts Theatre in spring 1989, he wasn’t expecting it to change his life. “It was a play about a dysfunctional married couple who get into a fight about a fancy dress party,” he says. Viv, who was the musical director and choreographer, had also been cast as his wife. The day she walked into the rehearsal theatre was “love at first sight” for him, he says. “She was wearing a powder blue skirt with matching blue socks and had the brightest red hair I’d ever seen. My jaw hit the floor.”
Viv, who is in her 50s, was dating someone else and didn’t feel the same instant attraction. “My first impression was that he was a crazy-looking guy with rainbow braces, a bit like a clown,” she laughs. Tim was convinced she was out of his league, but decided to build a friendship. They worked on four plays, including the one where they played husband and wife. Over the course of the three-week rehearsal period, followed by a three-week run of performances, they grew steadily closer.

It has all the comfort and joy of a classic, creamy carbonara, but with heaps of delicious, lighter-than-light, ribboned courgetti to complement the more substantial pasta and scoop up the garlicky, pancetta-flecked sauce.

The sole survivor of Sunday’s incident, a five-year-old Israeli boy living in Italy, remained in hospital in Turin on Monday.

Which list a country is put on depends on a number of factors including the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated, infection rates and the prevalence of variants of concern.

Franco Borrello’s black pigs roam freely in the bucolic foothills of eastern Sicily, where they graze and forage for acorns and wild roots in his 40 hectares (99 acres) of oak forest. Every year he loses several of them, as these ancient breeds of domesticated Sicilian pigs often sneak out from the metal enclosure.
Franco, 56, doesn’t care that much. “They practically live in the wild,” he says. “And it’s a price we’re willing to pay.”

In January, after a few attempts the previous days, Tony Hawk landed a 720 – a skateboarding trick involving two full rotations mid-air. Hawk is widely understood to have invented the 720, a move he has performed many times during his career. But this time, as he wrote on Twitter, it “was a battle … I can’t imagine doing any more”.
I’m speaking to Hawk from his car. He is on his way home to Encinitas, California, having just wrapped a snowboarding trip in Mammoth Mountain. At 53, it’s not that he’s physically incapable of performing the trick again, he says, but that “the risk” – think a broken pelvis and teeth knocked out – “versus the reward will not be worth it in years to come”.

I have a secret confession to make. I have (whisper it) yet to bake a cake. But now I have no excuse. Presenting 20 sublime, simple recipes to make you and me into a Prue or Paul. We have the buttercream of the cake-baking world: Jeremy Lee, Yotam Ottolenghi, Benjamina Ebuehi. There’s Meera Sodha’s salted miso brownies, Nigella Lawson’s birthday custard sponge, Anna Jones’s cardamom and carrot cake. There are cupcakes, sheet bakes, strawberry and cream cakes.

                    <span>The third photo essay in our series of work in collaboration with the Magnum Foundation focuses on the Batwa people in Uganda. The photojournalist Esther Mbabazi travelled to Bwindi national park and spent time photographing several families of the nomadic hunter-gatherers

This work is supported and produced by the Magnum Foundation, with a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation

In late March this year, Esther Mbabazi left behind Kampala, the chaotic capital of Uganda, and headed for the hills, forests, swamps and grasslands of Bwindi Impenetrable national park an eight-hour drive to the west. She went to find the communities of the Batwa people, who live on the park’s green, rainy edges.
Mbabazi, 26, had always been curious about the Batwa and wanted to find out how one of the most marginalised communities in east Africa had coped with the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent months she had been working on gruelling stories about human rights abuses following the disputed election in Uganda in January, and this new project, sponsored by the Magnum Foundation, was a welcome change.

It was a warm, sunny Saturday in May 2020 but Sophie Walker was locked inside her house in north London, in the dark, with her 10-year-old daughter. She had drawn all the curtains and was sitting well away from the windows, doing jigsaws, listening to the country singer Kacey Musgraves and counting down the hours until her husband came home from work.
Walker, who was the founding leader of the Women’s Equality party (WEP), had good reason to be fearful. The next morning her neighbour, whom she had asked to keep an eye on the house, would call to tell her his CCTV had captured a man hanging around outside her house at 4am. Later that day, she discovered the embers of a fire smouldering in her back garden. “Near the fire was a vodka bottle with petrol in it and a big pile of wood. The word ‘cunt’ was scrawled on the path in graffiti.”

Sicily’s prize pigs: can niche farms hold out against mega pork? 

The EU is to introduce sweeping reforms of farming subsidies this week to try to halt the decline of small farms and protect them from the intensification of agriculture fostered by decades of previous policies.
Janusz Wojciechowski, the EU agriculture commissioner, said: “My intention is that this process of disappearing small farms should be stopped. The European food sector in the past was based on small farms, and it should be in the future as well.”

Email and text frauds are nothing new – but with a boom in online shopping during the coronavirus crisis, their anonymous perpetrators have hit on a lucrative twist. Rachel Humphreys hears from Rose, who thought little of filling out a web form to arrange the redelivery of a pot of face cream and set off a chain of events that would wind up with a fraudster emptying her bank account. 

Rachel also speaks to Hilary Osborne, the Guardian’s money and consumer editor, who has been investigating the scale of the new wave of coronavirus scams and hearing from readers whose lives have been turned upside down – through the loss of their savings, but also a sense of shame.

The Prince of Wales has called for small family farmers in the UK and across the world to come together in a cooperative movement using sustainable farming methods, and for their plight to be at the centre of environmental action.
Small farmers, in the UK and EU, are facing their biggest upheavals in more than a generation, with the loss of farm subsidies and new post-Brexit trade deals in the UK, and sweeping reforms to the EU’s common agricultural policy to be announced this week in Brussels.

                    <span>Photographer Al J Thompson reflects on the decline of Spring Valley, a vibrant African-Caribbean suburb eroded by gentrification

Spring Valley is a suburb of New York, 22 miles north of Manhattan. In 1996 it became home to the photographer Al J Thompson, who moved from Jamaica at the age of 16 to join his mother who had settled there. At the time, Spring Valley had, in Thompson’s memory, a thriving and vibrant African-Caribbean community, centred around Spring Valley Memorial Park, where there would be jerk chicken cook-outs and long games of cricket at weekends, and kids his age would play football until it was dark.
Back then, there were big plans to develop the land around the park with new social housing projects, building on the community that lived there, tackling some of the social problems that existed. In the years that followed, however, the social housing did not get built, the land around the park was sold to developers for private condominiums, and the familiar patterns of gentrification followed. The mom-and-pop stores on Main Street were taken over by chains, the kids who dreamed of opening music studios never raised the money. Families like Thompson’s – two-thirds of Spring Valley’s community had been black – were priced out and moved even further towards the city’s margins. By the time he returned to Spring Valley in 2017, African-Caribbean numbers had halved, there were no cricket matches or cook-outs, and the old faces he saw in the park had a more hopeless look.

On a rain-lashed and windswept day in the Welsh valleys, Jonathan Huntley is almost at the end of the busiest six weeks of the year on his hillside farm. Lambing season is over, following the arrival of 1,400 newborns, and one of his 60 suckling cows is calving.
Huntley, 53, farms sheep and cattle in the same 500 acres as his father before him, and he and his wife Tracey hope their 22-year-old son Thomas will take over from them.

Anushka Asthana talks to Hazem Balousha, a Guardian correspondent who lives in Gaza. He describes living in, and reporting from, the strip, which was under heavy bombardment from last Monday until the agreement of a ceasefire, beginning early on Friday morning. The latest conflict started after Israel attempted to evict Palestinian residents from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in east Jerusalem and Israeli police stormed the Jerusalem compound which is home to al-Aqsa mosque after days of worsening clashes. Hamas issued an ultimatum for Israel to withdraw forces and as soon as that passed started firing rockets from Gaza into Israel. Hazem discusses the impact the bombardment has had on him, his family and other Gaza residents, and examines what would need to change for life to improve for them all.
Anushka also talks to Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian American professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia university in New York and the author of the Hundred Years’ War on Palestine about the history of the Palestinian struggle for statehood.

                    <span>Guardian Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips visits Jacarezinho, one of Rio’s biggest favelas, the day after police carried out the deadliest raid in the city’s history
Anushka Asthana talks to Tom Phillips about the police raid in Jacarezinho favela, in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. On 6 May police stormed the favela, targeting one of the city’s largest drug gangs, known as Red Command. Twenty-seven men were shot dead by police and one police officer was killed. Police, politicians and some parts of the media called the operation a “surgical” success. Human rights activists, community leaders and residents of the favela have described it as a massacre and are now calling for justice.
Tom tells Anushka about visiting the favela and meeting the residents the day after the attack. Rio’s favelas have suffered countless horrors since the drug conflict began to intensify in the mid-1980s and cocaine and war-grade weapons began flooding communities such as Jacarezinho. Since then, thousands of people – the majority young black men – have lost their lives to the relentless, corruption-fuelled skirmishes between police, drug traffickers and, increasingly, paramilitary gangs with ties to the state.
