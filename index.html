That’s all for today, thanks for following along. Here are some key links and developments from the day:
 1.00am BST 
While Biden has extended the federal eviction restrictions through July, advocates in California are growing increasingly concerned about the state ban on evictions that is due to expire next week. 
State officials have said California has $5.2bn to pay landlords all of what they were owed while giving low-income renters who have fallen into debt a clean slate. But advocates and officials in some of the hardest-hit cities, say they fear the plan will not reach the people in need and note that the process to dole out relief has been very slow.

The UK’s largest business lobby group has joined the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the human rights watchdog in calling for mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting, saying data collection will help tackle racial inequalities at work.
In a letter to the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), TUC and Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the move would help draw attention to pay disparities and a lack of minority representation across senior positions, and hopefully spark action by employers.

Almost 600m lateral flow tests given to the public in England may not yet have been used, according to a report that says the hugely expensive test-and-trace system is still bedevilled by problems.
The National Audit Office said NHS Test and Trace (NSHT&amp;T), which Boris Johnson promised would be world-beating and has a budget exceeding that of the Department for Transport, was struggling with some “fundamental parts” of its role.

                    <span>Harold Pinter theatre, London
In Yasmin Joseph’s play, three girls wind their way through the streets, guided by the spirit of the activist who founded the carnival
J’Ouvert evokes the spirit of carnival from its first, thumping beat: the ground-shaking thunder of music, the sweaty crush of crowds, the feathers and the floats with friends dancing on them.
We land in the thick of the Notting Hill carnival, just a few months after the nearby Grenfell Tower fire of 2017, though the focus of the play is the heritage and politics of this specific street party. Nads (the dominant friend, played by Gabrielle Brooks) and Jade (tough, protective, played with grit by Sapphire Joy) take us through their day, from Nads’ ambition to become dancing queen to Jade’s desire to mobilise and speak out. There are stories of leering, drunken men who exoticise or grope them; encounters with the older Caribbean community; and observations of the wealthy contingent that have gentrified the area. There are sparks in the girls’ friendship, too, when Nisha (Annice Boparai) joins them, though she remains a flat character; a middle-class do-gooder, hoping to share their intimacies.

This week Euro 2020 bade farewell to eight of the 24 countries who had qualified and the eliminated teams were met by quite contrasting headlines back home. As in every tournament there were those who had exceeded expectations and those who had fallen way below them
One of the dark horses of the tournament, Turkey, had a horrible experience and were dumped out after three straight defeats. The press did not hold back. The sports newspaper Fanatik led with the headline “The End” and wrote that the “Turkish wall crumbled”. Another sports newspaper Fotomac kept it simple: “Disgrace” while in his Fanatik column, Mehmet Demirkol wrote: “The zero [points] we watched do not even deserve a zero. We witnessed a managerial disaster class.”

England reach revised target to go 2-0 up with one to play

As England eased past Sri Lanka in their opening T20 encounter on Wednesday night they seemed to have an embarrassment of riches, but there was a time as the teams met again 24 hours later that they flirted with just plain embarrassment. Having restricted Sri Lanka to the meagre total of 111 they turned a procession into a problem with the loss of four early wickets, but a partnership of 53 between Sam Billings and Liam Livingstone settled their nerves and, after their target was trimmed to 103 because of a brief rain delay, they won by five wickets to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.
Livingstone has hit more explosive innings than his 26-ball 29 here, but it was tailored perfectly to the situation his team was in. The England captain, Eoin Morgan, complained afterwards that “every time we seemed to take a risk we lost a wicket” but Livingstone played conservatively until, with the die apparently cast, he ramped Dushmantha Chameera for six, his only boundary. “With Sam we tried to hit the fielders and run as hard as we could, and knock the runs off that way,” he said. “The rain actually helped the pitch a lot. It wasn’t easy going early on and it made the ball skid on more.”

                    <span>As Diana would be turning 60, this retelling of her life offered nothing new … apart from perhaps an insight into how bizarrely limited life was for gels like her
There is a moment in Diana, ITV’s feature-length documentary marking what would have been the princess’s 60th birthday, when, after her cousin and boarding school friend Diana McFarlane describes the teenage Diana having pictures of Prince Charles on her bedside table (“a sort of childhood crush really”), the makers cut to contemporaneous footage of the “dashing prince”. He is so definitively undashing that you cannot help but feel a point has, advertently or inadvertently, been made about the limited life view of young gels of Diana’s era and breeding.
That’s about as much insight, deliberate or otherwise, we are given in this offering. And really, why should there be more? We’ve had it all, surely, over the 24 years since she was killed in a car crash in Paris. And before that, during the years when her marriage to Charles was falling apart and they jockeyed for position and control of the narrative in the press, via interviews, leaks, tell-all books, meaningful silences, photo ops and all the messy rest of it.

Jordan Henderson: ‘Our young squad can be a positive thing’

Marcus Rashford has urged England to write their names into history by securing a famous victory over Germany in the last 16 of Euro 2020.
England have endured plenty of heartbreak against their old rivals in tournaments, but there is a belief within the camp that they will not be carrying any mental baggage when they face Joachim Löw’s side. Most of the squad are too young to remember their manager, Gareth Southgate, missing the decisive penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final against Germany and Rashford feels it is vital that they do not show any fear at Wembley on Tuesday.

It is more than 20 years since the man who won a record 150 Germany caps and became the first outfield player to appear in five World Cup finals hung up his boots but his competitive edge clearly remains. Matthäus – who captained Franz Beckenbauer’s side to their penalty shootout victory against England in the semi-final at Italia 90 but missed the Euro 96 rematch at Wembley after falling out with Jürgen Klinsmann and the manager Berti Vogts – is typically confident about Germany’s chances on Tuesday should it go the distance again.

Crews reported hearing noises from inside the rubble as they searched for survivors at the Champlain Towers South condo in Surfside, a 12-storey apartment block that came crashing down at about 1.30am. Authorities said they expected the number of deaths to rise, but would not be drawn on the number.

The doors of the last chance saloon are about to swing shut for Mo Farah’s Olympic qualification hopes, but there is a growing confidence in UK Athletics circles that he is injury-free and can revert to “Classic Mo” in his final attempt to make the Tokyo Games.
The 38-year-old’s chances of defending his Olympic 10,000m title appeared to be ebbing away when he plodded home 22 seconds outside the qualifying time of 27min 28sec at the British trials on 5 June. However, insiders at Font Romeu, where Farah has been training with the Scottish athlete Andy Butchart, say he has recovered from ankle niggle that affected him that night and are optimistic he will qualify for Tokyo at a hastily arranged 10,000m at the British Athletics Championships in Manchester on Friday

Ministers have sought to rescue the summer holiday season by easing travel restrictions for a number of tourist hotspots, amid a cabinet rift over plans to grant extra freedoms to people who have received both doses of their Covid vaccine.
But Thursday evening’s long-awaited move to scrap self-isolation for Britons returning from certain countries risked being immediately undermined, when some European leaders indicated they would toughen their own border measures to stop the UK’s surge in Delta variant infections in the UK hitting their shores.

Joe Biden has vowed that Afghans who helped the US military “are not going to be left behind” as his administration stepped up planning to evacuate thousands of Afghan interpreters while their applications for US entry are processed.
Planning has accelerated in recent days to relocate the Afghans and their families to other countries before the US military completes its withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to officials.

                    <span>Abbey, Dublin, and online
Una McKevitt’s droll domestic drama shows us a day in the life of a family dealing with the ill health of an ageing father
Reopening to live audiences for the first time in 15 months, the Abbey theatre’s warm welcome seems to come with a tongue-in-cheek smile. As audience members are individually escorted to their socially distanced seats, they are presented on stage with what they may have just left at home: a domestic interior, fitted out in realistic detail from kitchen sink to television.
Una McKevitt’s droll new play presents a single day in the life of a cooped-up family whose members are sorely in need of respite from each other. Although written during the pandemic, these characters are not actually in lockdown but tied together by the long-term illness of Frank (Bosco Hogan), who needs 24-hour care. His wife and carer, Brenda (Catherine Byrne), cannot leave the house without someone to keep an eye on him, and is fraying from exhaustion. Having chucked in her job, their adult daughter, Fiona (Liz Fitzgibbon), is back living at home – an unsatisfactory arrangement highlighted by a flying visit from her sister (Aoibhéann McCann).

A lot of us have been dreaming of plunging into the Balearic Islands’ glittering seas over the last year, and with a bit of luck the fantasy may become a reality before too long.
Floating in the Mediterranean isn’t the only thing on our Balearic wishlist though. We are thinking of staying in small hotels in inland villages, eating in restaurants that use the produce found in the surrounding countryside, and drinking wines from local vineyards. Of course, we still want to lie on the beach, but we might also want to explore by bike, paddle around the coast in a kayak or reboot on a yoga retreat.

Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, sparked backlash this week when he signed legislation cracking down on so-called educational “indoctrination” at colleges and universities, soon after the state banned critical race theory in its public schools.
“It used to be thought that a university campus was a place where you’d be exposed to a lot of different ideas. Unfortunately now, the norm is really these are more intellectually repressive environments,” DeSantis said during a press conference at a Fort Myers middle school.

                    <span>With inflationary pressures all too visible, Threadneedle Street could perhaps be slightly more worried
Inflation is “likely to exceed 3% for a temporary period”, says the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, which would prefer the emphasis to be put on the word “temporary”. The rate-setters, or most of them, are sticking to their script: once the inevitable strong period for growth and inflation is out of the way, both readings will fall back, so there’s no need to be alarmed.
The benign view has a lot going for it, of course. Inflation plunged last year during lockdowns and the reopening phase was bound to produce a spike of some size. May’s inflation reading was 2.1%, a relative surge from just 0.7% in March. But if the peak proves to be 3%-ish, the “transitory” narrative – central bankers’ favourite word these days – would still be intact.

Scientists advising the government on research into pilot mass events such as concerts and sports matches are frustrated at the delay in making the findings public and have been pressing for them to be released, the Guardian has learned.
Some of the events, which have included the Download music festival, the snooker world championships and a club night in Liverpool, took place as long ago as April and government sources say the results have been encouraging.

                    <span>Britney Spears has spoken out publicly for the first time against the controversial legal arrangement that has stripped her of independence for 13 years – and handed control of her estate, career and aspects of her personal life to her father, Jamie Spears, who also at times had authority over her medical and mental health treatment. 

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.

Arsenal are confident of signing Ben White from Brighton in the next few days after offering a deal worth up to £50m for the England defender. 
Arsenal had an initial £40m bid turned down this month, with Brighton indicating they wanted a guaranteed £50m for the 23-year-old. But the London club, who have agreed personal terms with White, hope their offer of an initial £45m plus £5m in add-ons can persuade Brighton to sell.

Thiel, a vocal opponent of higher taxes, is one of a number of ultra-rich Americans to use a Roth individual retirement account (IRA) to amass a tax-free fortune.

Robert Black, who was chief executive of the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) at the time of the fire, did not tell boards at the council and the arm’s-length management body about problems with smoke extractors at Grenfell, a deficiency notice issued by London fire brigade on the tower, or problems with fire doors at another block that suffered a fire.

Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, raised concerns not only about recent parent and community protests, which have led to children having to cross picket lines to get to school, but also a rise in pupil activism on issues such as racism, climate change and recent developments in the Middle East.

                    <span>Sir Jeffrey Donaldson may try to steer unionist opinion away from scrapping the protocol. But the UK government does not care
The past eight weeks have rocked Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party to its core, perhaps terminally. So it is not surprising that most of the DUP has reacted to the unopposed election of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson as the party’s third leader since Easter with something like exhausted relief. Sir Jeffrey will be confirmed as leader on Saturday, but he is already benefiting from a general sense that the recent period of fevered inner-party turmoil, in which Arlene Foster and Edwin Poots were each removed in short order as DUP leaders, could not be permitted to continue.
Feelings remain very high, however, and it is possible that Sir Jeffrey’s expected move against Northern Ireland’s first minister, Paul Givan, a Poots nominee, may rekindle the DUP civil war. It may therefore prove less bothersome if Mr Givan, installed only last week in a manoeuvre that backfired spectacularly on Mr Poots, stays on for a while, until Sir Jeffrey can join the Northern Ireland assembly and take over. That depends on how Mr Givan and his more fundamentalist wing of the party created by Ian Paisley in 1971 respond. A bitter radio interview by Mr Poots this week suggests wounds are deep.

                    <span>The outspoken tabloid’s closure is a chilling moment. But as Beijing silences dissent, the spirit of resistance endures
Apple Daily is dead. At midnight on Wednesday, Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy news outlet closed, forced out of business after authorities froze the assets of the 26-year-old tabloid and arrested executives and journalists. Through its outspoken support for protests, it had come to stand for resistance itself: for the freedom to know what is happening, to challenge authorities, and to imagine and demand another Hong Kong.
Beijing is determined to crush that resistance. Each day it turns the screws further. Many have fallen silent already, but Apple Daily was defiant. Its owner, Jimmy Lai, already jailed over a protest, could face life in prison due to further charges under the draconian national security law. The editor-in-chief and chief executive of its parent company have been charged with conspiracy to collude with “external elements” after 500 officers raided its headquarters last week. Authorities say that the case relates to articles calling for sanctions on the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, some published before the imposition of the security law, which is not supposed to be retroactive. This vindictive action marks the criminalisation of journalism. On Wednesday, the company announced it was closing overnight, citing employee safety and staffing levels after officers arrested its lead opinion writer.

                    <span>• Court: Trump lawyer made  ‘false and misleading’ statements
• License suspended pending possible disciplinary action
Rudy Giuliani is suspended from practicing law in New York state following disciplinary proceedings over his misleading statements to courts and the public following the 2020 US presidential election.
The New York supreme court issued its decision on Thursday, saying that it had found “uncontroverted evidence” that Giuliani made “demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public at large”, on behalf of his client, then-president Donald Trump, and created a “narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client”.

                    <span>Ineos rider Richie Porte acknowledges threat of 2020 winner
British team have strong lineup but uncertainty over leader

Although 184 riders will roll away from the Tour de France start line in Brest on Saturday, there are in fact fewer than a dozen contenders for victory in Paris on 18 July. The problem for most, though, is they do not ride for Ineos Grenadiers. 
After a poor Tour in 2020, the British team again look like holding all the cards, with four riders – Geraint Thomas, Richard Carapaz, Tao Geoghegan Hart and Richie Porte – all capable of playing a leadership role. The problem for Ineos Grenadiers, however, is that they have not hired the most exciting young rider in the sport.

One of England’s most popular tourist attractions has apologised after hundreds of visitors to Brighton Palace Pier were overcharged for fairground rides to the tune of thousands of pounds.
The pier – which is largely cashless – blamed the fiasco on the processing company Worldpay, which it said had used the date of the transaction instead of the actual amount in each case.

The turtle dove is a globally threatened species and is Britain’s most endangered breeding bird, with populations having halved in just five years and possibly fewer than 2,000 pairs left.

                    <span>The G7 summit had to have played a role in Cornwall’s case spike, writes Nick Jemmett. Plus letters by Brian Hatton, Richard Burtle, Jane McAdoo and Simon Routh 
Your article on the spike in Covid cases in places that were most used by G7 personnel during the summit in Cornwall (No 10 says G7 summit not to blame for rise in Cornwall’s Covid cases, 22 June) missed a major impact source: the 1,000-plus police officers housed on a cruise ship in Falmouth. They – like the other 4,000 or so police brought into the county – came from all over England and, unsurprisingly, a number of them were self-isolating on the ship after testing positive.
During the summit, off-duty officers were visible out in the town, in bars and other venues, and whereas it is assumed they adhered to Covid rules, it’s unlikely that all were Covid-free. Also, a large number of journalists were in the town. Falmouth has had one of the biggest spikes of Covid cases in Cornwall in June, and while half-term visitors and university students are a factor, the G7 must be seen as a major player in the outbreak. It’s disappointing, since Cornwall had hitherto made a huge effort in keeping Covid infection rates to among the lowest in the country.

                    <span>Peter Holbrook suggests an alternative to privatisation, while Peter Grimsdale points out that if the Tories sold off the broadcaster they would be trashing a bit of their own heritage
Following the news that the culture secretary is expected to launch a consultation into the future of Channel 4 (C4 privatisation would lead to regional cuts, broadcaster warns, 22 June), we urge the government to allow it to convert into a social enterprise. This would enable the broadcaster to maintain its independence and continue to commission programmes that serve a diverse audience, and use its profits to support independent production companies.
The UK is home to 100,000 social enterprises – businesses set up to trade for a social and environmental purpose, which reinvest the majority of their profits to further these aims. They contribute £60bn to the economy, employ 2 million people, and offer a path away from the binary choice of state ownership or privatisation.

A First Nation in Canada’s Saskatchewan province is treating a now-defunct residential school as a “crime scene” following the discovery of 751 unmarked graves just weeks after a similar discovery in British Columbia prompted a fresh reckoning over the country’s colonial past.
Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess First Nation said that the graves were found on the site of the Marieval Indian residential school, also known as Grayson, after a search with ground-penetrating radar was launched on 2 June.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The World Health Organization has made a new appeal for vaccines for Africa, saying a “fast-surging” third wave of Covid-19 is outpacing efforts to protect populations, “leaving more and more dangerously exposed”.
“The third wave is picking up speed, spreading faster, hitting harder. This is incredibly worrying. With rapidly rising case numbers and increasing reports of serious illness, the latest surge threatens to be Africa’s worst yet,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said on Thursday.

In March, Marshall had tweeted to the book’s author, conservative journalist Andy Ngo: “Congratulations. Finally had the time to read your important book. You’re a brave man.” Following an online backlash, he apologised, and announced he would take time away from the group. “Over the past few days I have come to better understand the pain caused by the book I endorsed,” he said, adding that he would “examine my blindspots”.

I have lots of fridge magnets commemorating Euro 2016, which renew my vigour as I replace my son’s Petit Filous because he’s thrown the first one I got him against the wall. “You have lived your dream,” I think, staring at Ashley Williams acknowledging the Welsh fans in Lille, “and no one comes round because of Covid anyway, so why does it matter that we have historic yoghurt splashes on the ceiling?”
I had fallen in love with the current group of Welsh players long before the tournament began, but they are constantly creating more fridge magnet moments. Aaron Ramsey’s Italian adventure in Turin meant I’d forgotten he sticks his tongue out at moments of high excitement, if you’ve ever wondered what a gifted international footballer crossed with a picture of a Westie on a tin of shortbread would look like.

In total, 140 cyclists were killed on the roads over the 12 months, up from 100 the year before, an increase the AA called “staggering”.

New EE customers or those upgrading after mid-July will have to pay £2 a day when they use their phones in 47 European countries from January. EE is the first UK operator to officially reintroduce roaming charges, although O2 has said it will impose an extra “fair use” charge if customers use more than 25GB of data in a month.

                    <span>On trade, finance, migration, food standards and more, the UK suffers fresh ignominy on a daily basis
Five years ago today, in the early hours, Britain discovered what it had done – and what had been done to it by the liars, charlatans and rogues who mis-sold Brexit as “taking back control”. The wound is as fresh as ever. Breaking apart political parties and reversing erstwhile red or blue wall seats is a minor matter, but Brexit’s explosive division of the country by social class, geography and a deep sense of personal identity is a lasting injury.
Few have changed their mind: though polls put remain (or return) ahead by a nose, no one wants to be put through that hell again. Brexit is done for the foreseeable future, though a government thriving on national disunity strives to keep it alive with infantile culture wars and “anti-woke” phoney patriotism. Polls give the Conservatives a 14-point lead, as they head into next week’s Batley and Spen byelection. No surprise, for what party in power could dream of a better boast than this: the vaccines are genuinely bestowing the gift of staying alive on every single citizen. And Britain is out ahead of other European countries: pollsters tell me voters sincerely (though unjustly) believe that had we remained in the EU, we couldn’t have had our own programme. Despite EU vaccinators catching up, and the UK having more people dead and more debt than they do, Covid is still a convenient cover.

                    <span>Discovery of tiny fossils indicates dinosaurs raised young in freezing region – and may have been warm-blooded
It had long stretches of winter darkness, freezing temperatures and often scarce resources, but an array of tiny fossils suggests dinosaurs not only roamed the Arctic, but hatched and raised their young there too.
While dinosaur fossils have previously been found in the Arctic, it was unclear whether they lived there year-round or were seasonal visitors.

A woman in Scotland has died from cervical cancer after more than 400 women were wrongly told they did not need to be screened.
Maree Todd, the Scottish public health minister, said a “serious adverse event” in a cervical cancer screening programme meant at least 430 women were not tested. Of those, a small number later developed cervical cancer, and one had since died.

When Angela Merkel attended her first EU summit in December 2005, her fellow leaders included Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac. It was a different world from the one that exists now as she attends what could be her last.
Europe’s divisions over the Iraq war were still raw. Blair was running the European Council, as the British held the EU’s rotating presidency. During the summit, the UK brokered a deal on the EU budget that cut the British rebate to pay for enlargement into central and eastern Europe.

There was a knock on the door. “Come in,” said the Queen, her heart sinking. It was the moment she had been dreading. Why on earth couldn’t she have carried on her weekly meetings with the prime minister on Zoom?
Not having to deal with Boris Johnson face to face had been one of the few upsides of the coronavirus lockdown. She couldn’t stand the way he put his feet up on the furniture and generally acted as if he owned the place. There was only so much entitlement a Queen could take.

“They thought we were terrorists,” says Joe Rush, remembering the day not long after the fall of the Berlin Wall when he and a fellow anarchist took over a patch of no man’s land at the heart of the German capital. They filled it with military hardware: tanks and artillery and the like – along with a MiG-21 fighter jet that they pointed directly at the nearby Reichstag.
“The authorities were furious,” he says. And no wonder. The police feared that, just as the cold war was ending, another military face-off had begun. “They thought we were going to fire missiles into the Reichstag,” says Rush. “So we pointed the MiG into the ground to make it clear we weren’t.”

The latest flare-up of violence in the Gaza Strip has been accompanied by a “catalogue of violations” committed by Israeli police against Palestinians in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, according to research from Amnesty International.
Arab citizens of Israel have been subjected to unlawful force from officers during peaceful demonstrations, sweeping mass arrests, torture and other ill-treatment in detention, and police have failed to protect Palestinians from premeditated attacks by rightwing Jewish extremists, the human rights watchdog said on Thursday.

                    <span>F1 champion concerned over Silverstone’s return to full capacity
Race takes place day before end of England’s Covid restrictions

Lewis Hamilton has expressed grave concern at the announcement that the British Grand Prix will host more than 140,000 spectators this year. The Formula One world champion believes the decision to allow a full-capacity crowd at Silverstone may be premature given the recent rise in Covid cases across the UK, fears British racing fans may be being used as test cases and has questioned the confusing messages coming from the government.
Silverstone confirmed on Thursday that it had got the green light for approximately 141,000 fans to watch the British GP, paving the way for the biggest UK crowd since the start of the pandemic. The grand prix takes place just one day before the mooted end of coronavirus restrictions in England on 19 July, and Silverstone officials will be allowed to sell out for the entire 16-18 July weekend.

When Billie Eilish appeared on the cover of Vogue’s June edition sporting a corset and a magnificent set of platinum blond curls, staring into camera and daring anyone to object, it felt properly shocking. Many on social media berated her, vigorously and unforgivingly, for “selling out”. Eilish was unfazed. She is, she said, an adult. She has every right to dress as she prefers. And at that moment, she preferred a corset.
She was, in effect, claiming her womanhood, her adulthood, her right to present herself in any way that makes her feel good. She was growing up, not giving in.

Although a Russian response to the Royal Navy warship’s passage within the 12-mile territorial limit was anticipated, the UK Ministry of Defence did not expect the Kremlin to speedily declare that warning shots had been fired.

“I’ve seen that movie,” says the director Jeremy Hersh, pulling a face. “I hope no one settles on that looking for this. It’s basically anti-women. The implication is that surrogates are crazy and calculating and out to steal some poor woman’s husband.”

                    <span>Former Lions captain, who won in South Africa in 1997, wants series to be decided by players, not red cards for high tackles
Can it really be 20 years since Martin Johnson last led a British &amp; Irish Lions side into battle? Listening to him even now is to be reminded that great Lions never entirely hang up their body armour. “The main things don’t change, do they?” says the last Lions captain to win a Test series in South Africa, in 1997.
“You’ve got a team of people who have to come together, find a common purpose and use that as motivation to overcome adversity. Everyone talks about the honour of it. The reality is that it’s a tough thing to do.”

                    <span>We have two years to create a coherent approach that appeals to non-Tory voters, who are the majority in Britain today
After the crushing 2019 general election defeat, the historic byelection loss in Hartlepool for Labour and the spectacular win for the Liberal Democrats in Chesham and Amersham, the idea of a “progressive alliance” is firmly in the political ether. But what is a progressive alliance, and how can it best work?
We start with the “why” of an alliance. The driving reason is political. The critical alliance is not one of parties or voters, but minds and then actions. The societal challenges we face; of climate, culture, care, technology, ageing and inequality simply can no longer be met by any single party. If we want a red, green and liberal future we need to meld the politics of these essential strands into a coherent and consistent political project, with urgency because the march of national populism wants to strip democracy of its power to deliver the hope of this good society.

Individuals and companies linked to the oil and gas industries have donated more than £400,000 to the Conservative party in the past year, while the government mulled controversial new licences to explore the North Sea for fossil fuel production sites, it can be revealed.
Disclosures from last July to the end of March, the latest date for which data is available, show at least £419,000 was given to the Conservatives by donors with a strong interest in oil and gas, including in the North Sea, research by the environmental investigations group DeSmog and the Guardian has found.

Staged in Sir John Soane’s Ealing mansion, Opie’s brand of dot-eyed simplicity – epitomised here by a sterile model town showpiece – is stuck in the 90s

A Julian Opie woman is striding towards the facade of Sir John Soane’s mansion in Ealing. This animated, larger-than-life figure in the forecourt is a flat sculpture for the digital age, flickering in white lines on a black screen mounted on a plinth. If you don’t know what I mean by a Julian Opie woman, she’s a line drawing in profile of someone in the street, stylish and contemporary. Other women in the show look at phones or tote bags in similarly simplified delineations.
I couldn’t help wondering what happens when she reaches the house. Will she bump her head? Or will the structure crumble into ruins under the impact of the 21st century? For Opie’s exhibition at Soane’s Pitzhanger Manor is not so much an encounter between new and old as a car crash in which a high-end motor smashes into a centuries-old yew tree.

Working seven days a week as a nurse and a fitness instructor, while bringing up two young daughters, Rebecca Logan led an extremely active life – until she contracted Covid-19 while working in the emergency department of a hospital in Northern Ireland.
Over a year after first falling ill, the 40-year-old is still suffering from long Covid. For Logan, that means she can only walk for five minutes before needing to rest, and there is a constant ringing in her ears. Her husband has had to pick up the slack at home, alongside his job as a school principal.

Jim Morrison frequently drew on his romantic dalliances for lyrical inspiration. Take Morrison Hotel’s raucous rocker Queen of the Highway, a song about his soon-to-be-wife, Pamela Courson, that frames their relationship as loving, if somewhat ill-fated: “He was a monster / Black dressed in leather / She was a princess / Queen of the Highway.”

This month’s design news celebrates projects that aim to do just that, from artist Annie Nicholson’s mental health support and ice cream project Fandangoe Whip to the biannual Index Prize shortlist which has a real focus on inclusive products. Special mention goes to social enterprise Love Welcomes, an organisation which brings craft skills, legal and business advice to women living in refugee camps. The Edge from U2 has designed a guitar strap for sale as part of their range.

                    <span>The model and actor has a new household installation - a pink tunnel where she goes to think. Vulval art and design has an ancient history, but it’s becoming more popular than ever
Should you swap all your doors for a vagina tunnel? This is the pressing question raised by a video tour from the model and actor Cara Delevingne, who takes Architectural Digest around her LA home, and I believe the answer has to be “yes”. In her living room, a secret door in the mirrored panelling reveals a soft pink opening. Crawl right in, take the dog with you (Delevingne does). “I come in here to think, I come in here to create, I feel inspired in the vagina tunnel,” says Delevingne.
Delevingne, and her architect, Nicolò Bini, were inspired, she says repeatedly, by Alice in Wonderland, but this is more like a vulval version of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe – the Chronicles of Labia, if you like. You climb out through a washing machine at the other end – “rebirthed and cleansed!” cries our host. The vagina’s rebirth powers are strong: Delevingne’s terrier goes in, and comes out a husky. The theme continues through the rest of the house: there is a floral display in her bedroom (“This lovely bouquet of vagina flowers”) and a “pussy palace”, a tactile pink suedette-lined secret room complete with swing and mirrored ceiling.

                    <span>Why have some brilliant innovations – from rolling luggage to electric cars – taken so long to come to market? Macho culture has a lot to answer for
In 1972 an American luggage executive unscrewed four castors from a wardrobe and fixed them to a suitcase. Then he put a strap on his contraption and trotted it gleefully around his house.
This was how Bernard Sadow invented the world’s first rolling suitcase. It happened roughly 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel and barely one year after Nasa managed to put two men on the surface of the moon using the largest rocket ever built. We had driven an electric rover with wheels on a foreign heavenly body and even invented the hamster wheel. So why did it take us so long to put wheels on suitcases? This has become something of a classic mystery of innovation.

                    <span>When facing scrutiny the institutions reacted in a rigid, defensive manner. It’s a common theme across Britain
Doris Lessing always asked awkward questions. She posed them in her novels on subjects such as sex, politics and illusion. She posed them in her journalism about nuclear weapons and migration. And she posed them in her table talk, as I know from occasional meetings in the 1990s in a West Hampstead cafe that also appeared in some of her fiction.
At one such lunch, Lessing – whose life and work take up the entire new issue of Critical Quarterly magazine – recounted the story, which she later wrote about in her autobiography, of one of the most enduringly awkward questions that even she ever asked. In 1952 she joined a group of leftwing British writers, including my father, on a cold war visit to Stalin’s Soviet Union. During the visit, she grew frustrated by the endless official Marxist rhetoric from her hosts. So she and my father devised a question they hoped would produce a more honest and human discussion.

On 7 November 1991, a press conference in Inglewood, California, brought America to a standstill. Against a black-draped backdrop, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and multicoloured tie, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, spoke calmly into a single microphone and told the world that he had been diagnosed with HIV.
Cameras flashed and reporters clamoured to ask questions, but Johnson, National Basketball Association (NBA) superstar and one of the world’s most revered athletes, appeared unfazed as he announced his immediate retirement. Had he grappled with his own mortality? When had he found out? How had he acquired the virus? What would he do next?

                    <span>For the hardline conservatives ruling Poland and Hungary, the transition from communism to liberal democracy was a mirage. They fervently believe a more decisive break with the past is needed to achieve national liberation
In the summer of 1992, a 29-year-old Hungarian with political ambitions made his first visit to the US. For six weeks he toured the country with a coterie of young Europeans, all expenses paid by the German Marshall Fund, a thinktank devoted to transatlantic cooperation.
America had long fascinated Viktor Orbán, but he seemed disengaged and unaffected as the group walked around downtown Los Angeles, which was still reeling from the Rodney King riots two months earlier. One Dutch journalist on the trip recalled that the eastern Europeans in the group preferred to spend their daily stipends on “a Walkman and other electronics” rather than on food or fancy hotels. The free market and cutting-edge technologies certainly appealed more to Orbán than American debates and struggles over equality, justice or the rights of people of colour.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

Like thousands of people, Dave Smith became infected with coronavirus at the start of the first wave in the UK in 2020. But while most people, including those who suffer “long Covid”, eliminate the live virus from their bodies within a couple of weeks, Smith experienced a very different sort of long-term problem: a persistent infection lasting more than 290 days, or almost 10 months. This has been the longest recorded active Covid-19 infection to date.
During that period, Smith, 72, from Bristol, recorded 42 positive PCR tests and was admitted to hospital seven times. He said: “Whenever I went bad, I went really bad – down to death’s door. My wife started to arrange a funeral five times.”

                    <span>The growth of non-fungible tokens has given rise to massive windfalls for those behind early virals. Sirin Kale and Alex Hern explain all
On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon due to the combination of social media and McCurry’s picture. Harambe’s image was everywhere. But, despite his photo being shared billions of times, McCurry did not see much of a financial benefit. Now advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.
The Guardian’s technology editor, Alex Hern, tells Rachel Humphreys that this year’s craze for NFTs follows in the wake of speculation on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Now similar technology means unique images, film clips, animations and even poems are being bought and sold online for increasingly large sums.

Boris Johnson’s government has set “historic” targets on the climate crisis but has failed so far to come up with the policies needed to reach them, the government’s independent advisers on the climate have warned.
The Climate Change Committee published two progress reports on Thursday, showing the UK lagging behind on its key goal of 78% cuts to greenhouse gases by 2035 and making recommendations on how to get back on track.

Almost two-thirds of wind and solar projects built globally last year will be able to generate cheaper electricity than even the world’s cheapest new coal plants, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).
The agency found that the falling cost of new windfarms and solar panels meant 62% of new renewable energy projects could undercut the cost of up to 800 gigawatts (GW) worth of coal plants, or almost enough to supply the UK’s electricity needs 10 times over.

                    <span>The brutal murder of a private investigator in 1987 has become the UK’s most investigated killing – but 34 years later it remains unsolved and mired in new official findings of police corruption
On 10 March 1987, a 37-year-old private investigator named Daniel Morgan was found dead in a south London pub car park with an axe embedded in his head. Despite the arrests of several men, the initial investigation did not lead to any charges and the murder has gone unsolved amid allegations of police corruption. 
The Metropolitan police have previously accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers. But a new panel inquiry concluded last week that the crime was probably “solvable” had it not been undermined. The force was described as “institutionally corrupt” and its commissioner, Cressida Dick, personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry.

A new wave of Covid-19 cases is threatening to disrupt another summer in the UK as the government extends restrictions for England into July amid concern about the rate of spread of the Delta variant. 
The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Anushka Asthana that this time around we are in a very different position with most adults now having had two vaccine jabs.

                    <span>From the Amazon to the Caribbean coast, several weeks of protests have swept Colombia – dozens have died as demonstrators have faced sometimes deadly retaliation from police. 
The catalyst was a proposed tax hike, since withdrawn, in response to the coronavirus crisis. Demands expanded to calls to end inequality, economic disparity and police violence in Colombia – in almost two months, demonstrations have caused food and goods shortages.
Protest leaders have temporarily suspended in-person demonstrations due to a rise in Covid cases, but Joe Parkin Daniels, reporting for the Guardian, explains why this widespread discontent is unlikely to end

Kelly Purvor remembers exactly where she was on her birthday in 2017: attending the opening of Daisy’s Dog Deli, a store dedicated to handmade canine treats and accessories, at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. Purvor’s self-appointed role that day was to stand outside, drumming up business by flyering passersby or ushering them into the shop where owner Lisa Gosling was busy serving customers. “Her support, as always, has been amazing,” says Gosling of the helping hand at the launch of her store (renamed Daisy’s Dog Empawrium in 2019).
Purvor’s relationship with Gosling and her business extends far beyond acting as, appropriately enough, a de facto “barker” that special day. Because she also happens to be Gosling’s local business manager at the Maidstone store of Metro Bank. It’s a working relationship that has grown over two decades, having begun in 2000 when Gosling won a competition for small businesses in the area. Gosling had traded in her long-term career as a chef to launch a business that combined her culinary skills and love of dogs by making hand-crafted canine treats, suitable for pooches with sensitive stomachs who have difficulties eating commercial dog food – such as her own dog, Daisy.

                    <span>Omar Abu al-Ouf lost his parents, grandparents and two siblings when his building was bombed by the Israeli military last month, in a street where 43 people were killed. Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>It may still sound like the stuff of science fiction, but some of the biggest companies in the world are investing hugely in previously fanciful transport technologies

From 2030, new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned in Britain – a sure sign that we’re on the threshold of a transport revolution. But what exactly will this revolution look like? With estimates that the market for autonomous vehicles could be worth almost £42bn in just over a decade, the future of transport looks to be anything but boring. Here are five things you need to know …
Driverless cars take to the roads
While fully autonomous vehicles (where the driver could, in theory, watch a film while the vehicle takes the controls) are still a way off, the first driverless cars – with automated lane-keeping systems that allow drivers to safely take their hands off the wheel – could be on Britain’s roads this year. In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix. The road to the driverless future may still be a little bumpy, but it is showing signs of smoothing out.
