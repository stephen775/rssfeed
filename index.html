Immediate action must be taken to save the UK’s music festivals from another “lost summer” due to Covid, a cross-party committee of MPs has said.
Ministers must create a government-backed insurance scheme for festivals as soon as possible, given their long lead times, a report from the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee argued, saying even now it would be too late for many events.

An 18-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to murder over the shooting of Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson.
The 27-year-old remains in a critical condition in hospital after being injured at a party in Peckham, south-east London in the early hours of Sunday.

Do you remember how, just a few short months ago, supporters of Donald Trump staged a violent insurrection? How they stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of last November’s presidential election, looting and vandalizing the seat of American democracy? The fact that they carried firearms, explosives and handcuffs, some wanting to kill Vice-President Mike Pence, and others to run the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, over with a car? And how the whole thing was incited by the former president, Donald Trump, who told the mob beforehand to “fight like hell”?

Luke Gale at majestic best to lead Leeds to victory

The tables can turn very quickly in Super League: just ask anyone associated with Castleford Tigers and Leeds Rhinos. Richard Agar had promised that, as his key players returned from injury, Leeds’ sluggish start to the season would slowly be overturned. But not even he could have predicted a night quite like this.
Nor would most Castleford supporters as recently as a fortnight ago, when their side were booking their place in the Challenge Cup semi-finals and starting the new league season with four victories from five games. But that, in a nutshell, is rugby league for you. Fortunes can change in the blink of an eye and how the Tigers will be hoping they do so again in the next seven days.

Tuilagi makes comeback in impressive win for Sharks

For now at least, courtesy of an extra win, Sale move ahead of Exeter into second place in the Premiership. There is some way to go before they can talk about a home semi-final but this seventh win in a row, after the pummelling their visitors subjected them to for long stretches, announces the Sharks as contenders.
Better still, Manu Tuilagi had more than half an hour from the bench and came through, a successful return to action after eight months out with an Achilles injury.

For the first time in nearly 30 years, a US president has released a budget that doesn’t ban federal funding for abortion.
On Friday, Joe Biden released his full budget proposal for fiscal year 2022, and in keeping with his campaign promise on abortion access, Biden did not include the Hyde amendment, an annual budget rider that bans federal Medicaid money from being used for almost all abortions. (There are exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or that would threaten the pregnant person’s life.)

                    <span>Jenny Valentish was determined to weaponise her body. In this extract from her new book, she writes of the sacrifices that come with gaining control
When I took up fighting, it quickly became apparent that my ego would be my gnarliest opponent. I was forty-three when I started, with a career in journalism based on independent decision-making – so I was far less amenable to being told what to do than a 12-year-old might be. As an adult I’ve had a tendency to avoid activities in which my performance would be anything less than above average.
It’s a testament to my ego – and the need for special treatment – that I pay for a personal Muay Thai trainer about 30 times more frequently than I attend a Muay Thai class. One of my trainer’s names, back in his MMA fighting days, was “the Human Bear Enclosure”. Since then, Nick Mann has stacked on another 30 kilograms of muscle in his reincarnation as a pro-wrestler called Gore – brother of another of my interviewees, KrackerJak. He walks like a blockbuster bad guy, arms held at bay by his swollen lats.

Innocuous to some, inspiring ire in others, stock can be a culinary dividing line. Marco Pierre White was branded a “shill” for flogging cubes, and another British chef, Tom Kerridge, found himself embroiled in a very middle class stir when he admitted his home use of those little kitchen helpers.

She grew up in Goomalling, in rural Western Australia, and started shooting in the 1930s using a simple cardboard camera called the box Brownie. The images in this collection share the happiest times of her life when her family lived and worked on a farm owned by a white family, protected from native welfare. But they were then moved to the Goomalling native eeserve where they were subject to Western Australia’s apartheid-style laws.

                    <span>Known for its beaches, surf breaks and social influencers, the holiday town on Australia’s east coast has recently earned a more sinister distinction
In Byron Bay, a coastal town at the easternmost point of mainland Australia, there are rainbow lorikeets everywhere. They fly between postcard palm trees: small blurs of yellow, red, orange, blue and green against a backdrop of cloudless skies.
It is almost too much – the colourful birds, the warm weather, the rolling hills, and of course, the Hollywood stars. Chris Hemsworth, Zac Efron and Matt Damon own property close to the town. Byron’s social media influencers – the murfers or “mum surfers”, in particular – are world famous, thanks to a profile in Vanity Fair. So potent are its charms that 2.2 million tourists visit Byron shire each year.

“Last night, while attending House of Commons proceedings virtually, in a non-public setting, I urinated without realizing I was on camera,” said William Amos, a member of Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberal party, in an apology posted to Twitter late on Thursday.

                    <span>The forward’s first season at the club has been a struggle but could yet end in triumph in the Champions League final
Timo Werner had scored 36 goals in his first year and a half at RB Leipzig but modesty prevailed when he was invited to assess his standard. “To become world class, you have to play in the really big teams,” he said in February 2018. “And then also play in big games like the final or semi-finals of the Champions League.”
The moment of anointment arrives in Porto on Saturday evening, or at least that is the idea. Last week Werner called his first campaign at Chelsea “the unluckiest season I have had and will have”, but the line between ill fortune and a place among the stars is vanishingly thin. All it might take is a 13th strike since his arrival last June: should he decide the biggest match of his career in Chelsea’s favour, most of the question marks that have accompanied him will evaporate.

A pair of piercing performances give real depth to Lisa Parry’s smart two-hander about faith and community
It is the end of the school week and precociously self-possessed 16-year-old Carys is in detention. Her hands and forearms are bandaged, as every Friday stigmata on her palms begin to weep. She claims that her feet too have recently begun to bleed. A video of this miracle is about to go viral. Her teacher Siân, yearning for her own absolution, threatens to call a crisis team, and outside on the schoolyard, an amassing crowd sings of angels. Signs are taken for wonders in The Merthyr Stigmatist, Lisa Parry’s taut and stirring two-hander about faith and community in Merthyr Tydfil.
Skilfully paced with direction by Emma Callander, it is a dramatic setup whose tension only increases over its running time of little under an hour. The airless and claustrophobic classroom is a microcosm for the world outside. Everybody knows everybody else’s business a little too well, and people are all still identified by their occupation: Bryn Books, John the Chippy, Carys Christ (“CC – like Coco Chanel”).

An investigation is under way at a hospital in Cumbria after a woman died weeks after being “dropped” from an operating table.
Jeanette Shields, 70, was dropped on the floor after a routine operation at the Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, according to her husband, John Shields.

‘It’s time to do things that I’ve always promised myself I’d do’

Gary Lineker is to leave his position as host of BT Sport’s Champions League coverage to follow Leicester in Europe as a fan next season.
The former England captain and Leicester, Tottenham and Barclona striker and BBC’s Match of the Day host has presented the channel’s coverage for six years but is quitting despite being offered a new deal to stay on. His final match will be Saturday’s Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City.

US politics – live updates

Joe Biden set out a $6tn budget proposal on Friday that, if passed, would fund a sweeping overhaul of US infrastructure and pour money into education and climate action, while driving government spending to its highest sustained levels since the second world war.
The president’s first budget is largely a political document, and faces months of difficult negotiations in Congress where Republicans are already balking at the scale of his spending plans. But it clearly sets out Biden’s ambition to remake the US after the coronavirus pandemic.

                    <span>My daughter, Lara Casalotti, who has died aged 30, had a reluctant media moment in 2016 when the Match4Lara campaign reverberated through national and international media. Diagnosed with a blood cancer (acute myeloid leukaemia), Lara needed a stem-cell transplant. When she learned that patients with black and minority-ethnic backgrounds like herself have a significantly smaller chance of finding a genetically matched stem-cell donor, Lara agreed to be the face and soul of a campaign to diversify the stem-cell registry for all.
Match4Lara, through a tremendous effort by her friends, family, Anthony Nolan and other organisations, registered more than 50,000 new stem-cell donors of more diverse backgrounds than previously on the registers. Many Match4Lara registrees have gone on to donate and save lives. Lara was fortunate that a generous donor was on the register and she received a transplant that gave her precious additional years.

Thomas Frank had not long finished wagging an index finger at ecstatic Brentford supporters on a victory lap last weekend – the message being that they are still one game from the Premier League – when the million-dollar question, or, in this case, £178m question, was put to him pitchside: how do you guarantee getting over the line this time? “One thing is for sure,” he replied, “I can’t make sure of anything, because this is football.”
That absurd game was categorical evidence of that. Frank booted a bin in fury as Bournemouth bounced into a two-goal aggregate lead inside five minutes before Chris Mepham’s sending-off helped Brentford wrestle the tie in their favour. Amid the bedlam that followed Marcus Forss’s winner, Ivan Toney tried to chuck what he presumed was a bucket of water over his teammates but inadvertently showered himself in disinfectant meant for the match balls.

In what can only be described as a comedy of errors, an Argentinian TV news channel delivered a stunning, if slightly flawed, scoop on Thursday night when it reported that William Shakespeare, “one of the most important writers in the English language” had died five months after receiving the Covid vaccine.
The gaffe of, well, Shakespearean proportions happened after Noelia Novillo, a newsreader on Canal 26, mixed up the Bard with William “Bill” Shakespeare, an 81-year-old Warwickshire man who became the second person in the world to get the Pfizer vaccine.

The question now is not so much whether the Republican party can be saved any time in the foreseeable future. It is what Joe Biden and the Democrats should do when faced with a party determined to subvert democracy through any means necessary, including violence.
On Friday Republicans in the Senate torpedoed an effort to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly insurrection by Donald Trump’s supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January, deploying the procedural move known as the filibuster to stop it even being debated.

The fallout from Naomi Osaka’s announcement that she will not be conducting her mandatory media duties at the French Open this year due to its effects on her mental health has continued at Roland Garros. Rafael Nadal, Ashleigh Barty and Daniil Medvedev were all asked to discuss Osaka’s comments during the pre-tournament media day.
Nadal, trying to win his 14th Roland Garros title over the next fortnight, affirmed his “respect” for Osaka and her decision while arguing for the importance of the press in promoting sports: “I respect it,” said Nadal. “I respect her, of course, as an athlete and her personality. I respect her decision. I don’t know. I mean, we as sports people, I mean, we need to be ready to accept the questions and to try to produce an answer, no?

Spain’s state-owned postal service has been accused of a damaging and counterproductive approach to equality after issuing a set of flesh-toned, anti-racism stamps in which the stamp with the lightest skin colour is worth more than twice as much as the darkest one.
On Tuesday, Correos España unveiled the set of four “equality stamps”: a pale, €1.60 one, a slightly darker €1.50 one, a brown €0.80 one, and a black €0.70 one.

Republicans killed the effort to set up a 9/11-style inquiry into the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob despite broad popular support for such an investigation and pleas from the family of a Capitol police officer who collapsed and died after the siege and other officers who battled the rioters.

The clashes came days after a supreme court justice ordered the government to protect indigenous populations threatened by the miners who appear to have been emboldened by President Jair Bolsonaro.

The Group Three John Of Gaunt Stakes is the feature event on Saturday’s card at Haydock but from a betting angle it looks more like a handicap and Safe Voyage, the likely favourite to repeat his success in 2019, is giving 5lb to his most dangerous opponents.
John Quinn’s eight-year-old has been admirably consistent throughout his career and hit new heights with a pair of Group Two victories last year. He was also within half a length of the winner in a Group One at Longchamp in October. However, he showed little on his seasonal reappearance in the Lockinge and it is a nagging concern that his penalty leaves him vulnerable to a younger, more progressive rival.

Barack Obama and Marcus Rashford have teamed up to encourage young people to shape their own destinies and the societies in which they live. The former US president and the Manchester United and England forward met in a Zoom meeting arranged by Penguin Books, and posted to YouTube on Friday, to discuss the motivations behind their own activism and their eagerness to inspire others to create change.
“The thing I want young people to see is that even in the highest reaches of power, where I’m sitting with world leaders and we’re trying to design a programme to deal with climate change or end a war or address a major world economic crisis, it’s still just humans,” said Obama. “It’s still just people. So often for many young people, particularly young people who are poor or don’t come from well-connected families or young people of colour or women or people of different sexual orientation, so often we feel like outsiders, not sure we belong at the table in making those decisions.

                    <span>Fossil fuel firms are being held responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. That’s a good thing
History was made in the Hague district court this week. Judge Larisa Alwin ruled that Shell, one of the world’s biggest oil companies, must cut its emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels. Until Wednesday, courts in the Netherlands, France and Germany had concentrated on holding governments to their commitments under the Paris climate deal of 2015. States were found guilty of denying basic rights to future citizens, triggering more ambitious climate plans. The landmark Hague ruling shows that corporations can now be ordered to comply with the goals of the Paris agreement.
Governments are supposed to design the regulatory frameworks and put in place the laws so that companies and households steadily reduce their carbon emissions. But this relies on private entities playing their part. If they do not, preferring to hide behind slick PR, the law can step in. The judge accepted the argument that Shell had failed in its duty to respect human rights by failing to adequately curb its role in global heating. Shell’s goals to mitigate its climate impact, the court found, “largely amount to rather intangible, undefined and non-binding plans for the long term”.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Tory MPs who wish to see Matt Hancock leave the cabinet are frustrated this weekend. They believe that the health secretary’s career was already in the sights of Boris Johnson before Dominic Cummings’ full-frontal attack on Wednesday.
But as a consequence of Cummings’ explosive claims that Hancock repeatedly lied to Johnson, the cabinet and the public – resulting in tens of thousands of extra deaths from Covid-19 – senior Tories, including the PM, have been forced publicly to back the health secretary.

                    <span>Old languages are far from dead – and knowledge of their subtleties advances by the day
A new two-volume ancient Greek-English lexicon has just been published by Cambridge University. The work of over 20 years, it defines 37,000 words. One might wonder why such a thing might be needed. After all, Liddell and Scott’s Greek dictionary, with its early-20th-century revisions, has served scholars well since 1843. And isn’t ancient Greek a dead language anyway?
By no means. Scholars constantly broaden knowledge of the language. The later 19th century saw a profusion of Greek texts excavated in Egypt, where the dry sands preserved millions of papyrus fragments – not just literature but bills, letters and even magical spells, full of new usages that are still being studied (not all of this is reflected in the new lexicon). In recent decades, the canon has broadened towards the abundant Greek writing produced under the Roman empire – though, since the new dictionary advances only to the second century AD, it, alas, omits much of this material.

Total income from farming, calculated annually by the government, fell from nearly £5.2bn in 2019 to just over £4.1bn in 2020, the lowest value in real terms since 2007.

The Cambridge professor whose argument against a herd immunity strategy helped trigger England’s first lockdown has voiced concerns about the risks of easing restrictions next month.
Prof Sir Tim Gowers sent Dominic Cummings a five-page document warning of the need to “move urgently to extreme containment measures” in March last year. Boris Johnson’s former chief aide told MPs this week it had influenced a critical change in the government’s early thinking, with lockdown announced two days later.

Taksim Square, one of Istanbul’s most famous cultural battlegrounds and the scene of 2013 protests against Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has officially embraced a new religious identity after the inauguration of an imposing new mosque.
The controversial project was opened by Erdoğan on Friday after four years of construction. With two minarets and a 30-metre-high dome, the huge art deco building symbolically dwarfs the square’s Republic Monument – which depicts Turkey’s secularist founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk – as well as the nearby Hagia Triada Greek Orthodox church.

The grim discovery at the former school near the town of Kamloops was announced late on Thursday by the Tk’emlups te Secwépemc people after the site was examined by a team using ground-penetrating radar.

Colombian remains 2min 29sec clear of Damiano Caruso

Simon Yates won stage 19 of the Giro d’Italia to set up a fascinating final weekend even as Egan Bernal added a few more seconds to his overall lead.
Just as he did up the Sega di Ala on Wednesday, Yates rode away from Bernal on the Alpe di Mera at the end of the 166km stage from Abbiategrasso, taking 28 seconds out of the Colombian who remains troubled by a back problem. Bernal took third to push his advantage over second-placed Damiano Caruso up to 2min 29 sec, but all eyes will be on the in-form Yates – 20 seconds further back in third – going into Saturday’s brutal stage to the Alpe Motta before Sunday’s closing time-trial in Milan.

We congratulate Dan Hancox, and the family campaigners who helped him, for bringing into the open at last the story of the Chinese seamen secretly rounded up and forcibly deported from Liverpool as soon as their services were no longer required for the war effort (The secret deportations: how Britain betrayed the Chinese men who served the country in the war, 25 May). Nothing can compensate for the suffering inflicted on them, and on the wives and children from whom they were so cruelly separated with neither explanation nor farewell.
Truth and contrition are the least that can be expected. It is sad but revealing that even now ministers cannot bring themselves to apologise to the victims’ descendants for this shameful episode in our history. The institutional racism with which we continue to struggle in our country has deep roots.

                    <span>Honesty and competence are no longer valued in political leaders – and the former No 10 adviser is one of the reasons why
He did not quite shoot people on Fifth Avenue, but he came pretty close. According to his former closest adviser, Boris Johnson and his government are responsible for the fact that “Tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die.” And yet, so far, there are few signs that the prime minister will pay a price for the allegations of criminal, murderous negligence that Dominic Cummings sought to pin on him. On the contrary, his approval ratings are in rude good health, with the opposition limping far behind. Just as Donald Trump bragged that he could stand in the centre of Manhattan gunning people down and still not lose any votes, so Johnson can apparently survive the charge that he has the blood of innocents on his hands, levelled at him by the man who was once his most senior lieutenant.
The Cummings testimony, delivered in seven sensational hours on Wednesday, should be devastating for a sitting prime minister. To have his former chief adviser tell MPs that he was “unfit” for the job, that he had bungled and botched life-and-death decisions affecting millions, that he led a government that had failed “when the public needed us most”, should be a disqualifying event, triggering talk of resignation and motions of no confidence. That it isn’t turns on the personalities of the men involved and the current public mood, but also something deeper and more troubling about the politics of the age.

With the government in England considering extended school hours as part of its catch-up plans, the research found that schools already timetabling longer teaching time in subjects such as English and maths see only modest improvements that may not justify the extra cost.

The jab from US-based pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson is considered a key tool in the global arsenal against Covid, given it is a one-dose regimen, unlike the the other three vaccines approved for UK use that require two shots to provide a high level of protection.

                    <span>Call for lawyer who defended South Yorkshire police’s former solicitor to retract comments and apologise

The mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region have formally complained to the Bar Standards Board about comments by a QC appearing to blame misbehaviour by Liverpool supporters for the Hillsborough disaster.
Jonathan Goldberg QC, a veteran barrister, defended South Yorkshire police’s former solicitor, Peter Metcalf, against a charge of perverting the course of justice, in a trial that collapsed on Wednesday. He later told the BBC that the behaviour of Liverpool fans on the day of the tragedy was “perfectly appalling … causing a riot”.

                    <span>AA says it does not expect ‘travel chaos’ but traffic is likely to grow on peak routes at peak times
Sunny weather, the easing of Covid restrictions and the return of road traffic to pre-pandemic levels could combine to bring back traditional bank holiday jams in coastal areas, motoring organisations have said.
The RAC said that about 11m journeys could be made over the weekend, the start of the half-term holiday for most schools. The AA said it did “not expect travel chaos”, but in the first long weekend since the last easing of lockdown, traffic was likely to grow on peak routes.

For many Chinese millennials, the US sitcom Friends was a window to the American way of life. Teachers would use the show to help students learn English. Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai have Friends-themed Central Perk cafes. So when news that the original cast were to hold a reunion special nearly 20 years after the show was first introduced into China, diehard fans were excited, and some of China’s biggest online streaming platforms bought the rights to broadcast the show.
But eagle-eyed viewers complained on Thursday that some of the much-talked-about scenes in the original 104-minute runtime were missing.

As many prepared y to get away or visit family over the weekend, Covid-proof plans were formed with military precision across the country, with every contingency factored in, from yet another government U-turn to the discovery of a new variant.

I’m in my late 40s and have a brother who is a couple of years younger than me. He’s been happily married for almost 20 years and has a lovely daughter, who is in her early teens.
Some years ago, he was treated for cancer (he has been in remission since), and I am happy he has managed to find his way in life. Our parents died two years ago, and we are all the family we have; we’ve had our differences, but in reconciling we probably understand each other better than ever.

Last night’s Downing Street coronavirus briefing was given by Matt Hancock, now identifiable only by his dental records. According to Dominic Cummings, Hancock was a serial liar at a deadly level who should have been sacked 15 or 20 times. According to himself, Matt Hancock “threw a ring around care homes”. It would have been a lot better if he’d thrown the ring into Mount Doom instead.
Elsewhere, it has emerged that a government that came to power promising to control our borders has allowed 1.59 million – ONE POINT FIVE NINE MILLION – travellers to fly into the UK in the four lockdown months from January to April alone, two-thirds of whom were not UK nationals. If we don’t open up fully in three weeks, make sure to thank the Conservatives by popping a couple more points on their poll ratings.

When MI5 marked its own homework over the Fishmongers’ Hall attack, it concluded there was nothing it could have done to stop Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist, from killing Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones.
But evidence presented to the inquest into their deaths casts doubt on this rosy self-assessment and the jury criticised “missed opportunities for those with expertise”. Six weeks of testimony detailed numerous failed chances to stop Khan and a series of glaring warning signs about his behaviour and state of mind in the run-up to the attack.

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, came close to an all-out call for regime change as she issued the pledge of funds in return for a “transition” to democracy.

One of the showcase events of Coventry’s reign as the UK City of Culture is 2 Tone: Lives &amp; Legacies exhibition at Coventry’s Herbert Gallery &amp; Museum, which opens today and bills itself as “the first-ever major exhibition in the UK devoted to the 2 Tone music sensation”. A statement that must have raised a few eyebrows over at the volunteer-run Coventry Music Museum, which has been flying the 2 Tone flag for nearly a decade, and has just opened its own exhibition, from Ghost Town to Host Town, celebrating the Specials number one hit and most famous song ever to come out of the city.
2 Tone was the Coventry record label and music movement started by Jerry Dammers in the late 70s that combined upbeat Jamaican ska and its rude boy look with the energy of punk, and launched local multiracial bands the Specials and the Selecter, as well as Madness and the Beat.

An inquiry has been under way for eight years into the 1987 killing of Daniel Morgan, who was found in a south London pub car park with an axe embedded in his head.

No woman wants to feel like their partner’s mother, but sometimes there is no escape. I feel it most at night. “Go to bed!” I say, pointing towards the bedroom. “It’s 1am and you have school, sorry, work in the morning.” But my bloodshot-eyed boyfriend-man does not move from the sofa, muttering something about “just another five minutes” of Lewis Hamilton highlights on YouTube, which I know will actually be 20.
“I don’t want to nag,” I’ll say another time, lying in bed with my sleeping mask flipped, squinting. “But this is madness. If you’re going to work 12-hour days, you need your rest. I’ve seen how battered you get.”

Last week I was back in the office for a writing day with other people. We were, of course, socially distanced and working behind plastic screens, giving the effect that we were not only writing, but also prepared in case anyone wanted to come in and pay in a cheque.
The night before I was due to go into London, I went to check the train times and found myself feeling slightly emotional about using the train app. “Emotional” is perhaps an exaggeration, given its implication that I was teary-eyed at the discovery of which platform I would be standing on the next day at Three Bridges, but the point is I felt something. It was a little step towards normality. Of course, by normality I mean the normality of travelling to the jobs we’ve all made up to give our existence some sort of imagined purpose.

By day, the tombaroli, or tomb raiders, marked out the spot. They used long, pointed tools to pierce the earth, beneath which there was a passage that would take them to Roman homes replete with treasure in Civita Giuliana, a suburb of ancient Pompeii, about 700 metres north-west of the main archaeological park.
By night, they dug a network of tunnels. Each was about 40 metres long, starting from their home or abandoned buildings in the countryside area close to the site, and connected to the passage, from where they hammered through ancient walls as they made their way into the homes to seize their loot.

I was only 10 years old the first time the police stopped me. My house was out of town, but Dad lived in the centre of Nottingham where officers were always around. I’d seen other black kids being hassled when I’d been at his, but at that age I’m not sure the significance of it registered.
That was, until I – a primary school pupil – was being publicly poked and prodded by fully grown adults in uniform because of the colour of my skin. I’m still not entirely sure what they’d convinced themselves they were looking for as they questioned me.

                    <span>The relatives of the 96 victims of the disaster have waited 32 years to be told that their efforts and suffering were for nothing
For the families of the 96 people unlawfully killed at Hillsborough due to police gross negligence, a nightmare 32-year ordeal through the British legal system has ended with an outcome that feels like a final insult.
The result is that nobody has been held accountable for the needless deaths, injuries and enduring trauma suffered at a showpiece event, the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, due to be broadcast to the nation by the BBC on a sunny day in April 1989. After the bizarre conclusion this week of the latest failed case brought by the Crown Prosecution Service, nobody has been held accountable either for the lies of the South Yorkshire police, which started even as people were dying, and attempted to blame the victims rather than take responsibility for what had happened.

The statue of the slave trader Edward Colston will go on display in a Bristol museum almost a year to the day after it was hauled from its plinth in the city centre by Black Lives Matter protesters and thrown into the city’s harbour.
Colston’s statue will form the centrepiece of a temporary exhibition at the M Shed museum and a survey will be launched to try to find out what people think should happen to it next.

                    <span>Observers are undecided whether the TV channel is setting the agenda or reflecting a reactionary shift 
CNews, the Paris-based news channel whose heated talkshows on crime and immigration has led critics to call it a “French Fox News”, this month hit record viewing figures, leading to concerns on the left that its focus on law and order and national identity could boost the far-right Marine Le Pen at next year’s presidential election.
The free-to-air news channel, which is part of the Canal+ group owned by the French industrialist Vincent Bolloré, has more than doubled its viewers over the past two years with its unique brand of raucous current-affairs debate shows, where well-known right-wing commentators thrash out their views with political figures from across the spectrum, and news bulletins that are often led by stories on crime and immigration.

                    <span>Tudor-style square necks back in fashion as new drama on life of Henry VIII’s second wife comes to TV

In the best-known portrait purported to be of Anne Boleyn, a square neckline frames her long, slender neck, foreshadowing her grisly date with the executioner at the Tower of London in 1536.
Debates about Boleyn’s appearance – and how many fingers she had – have raged for centuries and no uncontested contemporary portraits of her survive. But most historians agree that her style of dress, which was influenced by her early life in France, set trends in the English court. She is often depicted wearing a low square neckline, a French-influenced style that came to dominate Tudor dress.

Punk fans, however, have been tuning in each week not to discover the identity of the murderer loose in the Pennsylvania suburbs but to catch a glimpse of the show’s fake band, Androgynous.

                    <span>It’s not too late to book a last-minute campsite for half-term. Here’s our pick of sites with space left
Wardley Hill is a family-owned, off-grid campsite in six acres of the Waveney Valley near Beccles, on the edge of the Norfolk Broads. Wildflowers and grass are left to grow to encourage bees and butterflies, interspersed with mown spots for camping (there is space for up to 15 tents and four campervans). Glamping options include tree tents, bell tents and huts, including one with hammocks for beds. The site has a woodland, a small stream and tree ponds, plus a recreation field for cricket and kite-flying. There are compost toilets, two hot open-topped showers, fire drums made from old washing machines and a book exchange. Beccles has a heated lido, which is also the starting point for the Big Dog Ferry, a three-mile boat trip along the River Waveney to the Locks Inn community pub. Norwich is a half-hour drive away.

Christina Ebenezer first started taking photos with a group of friends when she was a 17-year-old student. Even then, she noticed the difference in how her camera captured people of different skin tones.
“I didn’t think much about this until I got older and became more experienced in photography. It was when I learned that the early Kodak Vericolor Shirley Cards were based on various white women that I thought OK, this was an industry standard that was not made with people like me in mind,” Ebenezer, who has photographed for British Vogue, British GQ, and Vanity Fair, said.

                    <span>From the priest who wears his collar on holiday to the tailor who suits up for absolutely everything, here are the people who have found their look – and aren’t going to change it for anything
I always wear Issey Miyake tunic dresses and shawls, in various colours, with leggings and boots in winter, secured with three vintage Bakelite brooches. I have been wearing this uniform for about 10 years. After I gained weight, I couldn’t find anything that looked good and was in my size. I discovered the Japanese designer on eBay, where I also discovered vintage handbags and briefcases, and Bakelite jewellery, to accessorise with. All of these items are reasonably priced on the secondhand market, and I like the sustainability: I have had some pieces for a decade, and they are still in great shape. It’s fun to have someone drive by and say: “I love your clothes!” That gives me a kick. I don’t have to spend a lot of money on clothes any more, and it takes me five minutes to get dressed. I know which clothes fit and look good, and being dressed in beautiful clothing helps to combat ageism and fat shaming. Leslie Dollen, retired, Minnesota

At the starting line of the Gansu ultramarathon, it was cold but the sun was shining. One competitor struggled to warm up, even after jogging a quick 2km, and noticed some of the elite competitors were wearing shorts and shivering. In nearby towns, the temperature was reportedly already dropping and winds increasing, but the 172 runners didn’t know that.
In a widely shared account of the horror that followed, published online, the anonymous runner described the conditions that led to the death of 21 competitors and the admission of eight others to hospital, and sparked major questions about the safety of the increasingly popular endurance sport in China.

Although legislation around marriage has changed over the last 10 years – from the introduction of same sex marriage to civil partnerships being extended to heterosexual couples – what has remained the same is the idea that marriage is for two parties romantically involved in each other. 
However, across Europe and America, the beginnings of a trend seem to be emerging: platonic marriage. This is where two parties get married as a celebration of deep friendship, rather than romance, and where their best friend is their significant other with whom they are building a life (eg. raising children).

Georgia Anne Muldrow may be more than 20 albums into her career and the woman who brought the word “woke” to wider consciousness, but she is not one for counting off milestones. “I’m the type of traditionalist that wants to give meaning to life,” she says. “My [concept of] success is directly linked to how Black folks see themselves; it’s not enough for me to be filthy rich or something, owning an island somewhere in the midst of what we live through.”
Since debuting with her EP Worthnothings in 2006, she has become known for her chameleonic ability to master different genres – soul, G-funk, jazz, electronic – under a number of aliases (for instance Jyoti) and collaborative projects. Last week, the 37-year-old vocalist, songwriter and producer released Vweto III, the latest in a series of beat tapes. These are self-produced and mostly instrumental albums full of psychedelic funk and prowling hip-hop (track titles such as Boom Bap Is My Homegirl show where her head is at). Besides solo releases, she has been featured on tracks by artists such as Erykah Badu, Flying Lotus and Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), who described her as “like [Roberta] Flack, Nina Simone, Ella [Fitzgerald] – she’s something else”.

                    <span>The 10-episode YA series, based on the novel by Lauren Oliver, places small-town teens in a life-or-death game with zero dramatic tension
Amazon’s Panic, a 10-episode series based on the YA novel by Lauren Oliver, launches off a cliff (literally) with an improbable premise: that small-town teenagers in the late 2010s would believe in and submit to a secret ritual competition at risk of death, and not tell anyone about it.
The fictional Panic game, in which graduating seniors of Carp, Texas, population 12,000, try to outlast each other in daredevil challenges for a roughly $50,000 pot, mixes the relatively benign, suburban American high school tradition of Nerf gun wars or spoon assassins with the appeal of Fear Factor – sans safety measures – and the compulsory buy-in of The Hunger Games (a dollar a school day for every student, mandatory). “No one knows who invented Panic, or when it first began,” says Heather Nill (Olivia Welch), in the series opener, and bafflingly few characters seem interested in questioning a tradition which killed two classmates the prior summer under mysterious circumstances.

Cillian Murphy, star of the new horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II, is something to behold: X-ray eyes at once penetrating and ethereally blue, cheekbones so pronounced you could stretch out and go to sleep on them. Unfortunately, the beholding will have to wait. We have barely exchanged greetings over Zoom when his voice breaks up, the screen freezes and the room falls silent. A quiet place, indeed.
We switch to phones. We can do this, I tell him. “I have faith,” he replies, in a soothing Cork accent that compensates for the lack of visuals. Murphy’s gift for intensity has made him a natural fit for characters damaged (Dunkirk, The Edge of Love) or outright villainous (Batman Begins, Red Eye), but today he is quick to laugh and keen to talk. He is speaking from a flat in Manchester, where he is staying while he shoots the sixth and final series of Peaky Blinders. That stylish crime drama, which rocketed from BBC Two cult success to global phenomenon, revolves around a 1920s Birmingham gang led by Murphy as the vicious Tommy Shelby. With his eyes, looks could kill – although he keeps razor blades in the brim of his cap, just in case.

                    <span>Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova examines why Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, apparently diverted a Ryanair flight in order to arrest 26-year-old blogger Raman Pratasevich. Guardian Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, discusses the fallout from the action
Anushka Asthana talks to the Belarusian journalist Hanna Liubakova about the 26-year-old opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his 23-year-old girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. On Sunday their Ryanair flight, which was meant to be flying to Lithuania, was forced to make an emergency landing in Minsk and they were arrested. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the Belarusian opposition leader, told the European parliament on Wednesday that Lukashenko was “turning the country into the North Korea of Europe: non-transparent, unpredictable and dangerous”.
Anushka also talks to the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth about the international reaction to what has been called a ‘state-sponsored hijacking’. The British government has told all UK planes to cease flying over Belarus, while the EU has imposed new economic sanctions. Kremlin officials have offered only muted support over the incident.

The world needs to quadruple its annual investment in nature if the climate, biodiversity and land degradation crises are to be tackled by the middle of the century, according to a new UN report.
Investing just 0.1% of global GDP every year in restorative agriculture, forests, pollution management and protected areas to close a $4.1tn (£2.9tn) financial gap by 2050 could avoid the breakdown of natural ecosystem “services” such as clean water, food and flood protection, the report said.

With travel still subject to strict Covid rules, many of us will be opting to stay put this summer. But while we often idolise the idea of a sun-filled getaway, in reality, our holidays can sometimes fail to meet expectations – and sometimes they can be downright disastrous.
With this in mind, we’d love to hear about your holiday catastrophes and the trips that didn’t go according to plan, as a reminder that we might not always be missing out after all. Perhaps your luxurious city break was ruined by terrible weather? Or maybe your backpacking adventure plans were quashed by a bout of food poisoning?

Jane Gilbert, who has been tasked by Miami-Dade county with coordinating and accelerating efforts to protect lives from extreme heat, said that more focus was needed on what has been called the “silent killer” of the climate crisis.

Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff tells Anushka Asthana that it was the first chance to get a detailed firsthand account of what was going on in the heart of government as the crisis unfolded. But how much should Cummings himself be seen as culpable for the failures?

                    <span>Wetting yourself isn’t something that happens just to older people or women who’ve given birth. A quarter of men over 40 experience some form of leakage, yet many are loath to speak out
Incontinence comes loaded with misconceptions, not least that it’s a women’s or older person’s problem. This could be why so many younger men stay silent when urinary incontinence strikes. Here, we look at what causes a condition that is far more widespread than many think – and how it’s eminently treatable.
How common is male incontinence?
A quarter of men over the age of 40 experience some form of urine leakage according to research by the global health and hygiene company Essity. And, in the US, the National Association for Continence says that incontinence affects as many as 15% of men aged 15-64, which belies the myth that it’s only postpartum or menopausal women who suffer from it.

I know for a fact that tonight I’m going to get lucky: I’m definitely going to have sex. According to a study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, the average American has sex 54 times a year, which roughly translates to once a week with a couple of extra times thrown in for special occasions. And today is my birthday. I’m turning 55. And like all my birthdays for the past 20 years I’ve been married, my bonus present is sex. But, special occasion or not, given that I’m pushing up in years this is a good moment to take stock of how my sex life has changed over time – and what I’ve learned as a sex therapist about how other men age through the life-cycle.

“I’ve recently started talking to my personal trainer about my period. He’s a good looking 25-year-old and I felt myself burning up with embarrassment when he asked why I was lacking in energy one week. I went to lie but then thought, why do women still feel shame about this? He looked a bit uncomfortable but since then I have tried to make a point of talking about my cycle as ultimately it affects my body and my performance, which is completely relevant to his job as my trainer. It still feels ‘wrong’ and almost distasteful to talk about, but I know it shouldn’t.” Sammy, 43

Despite a Saudi-led bombing campaign that has destroyed Yemeni infrastructure and crippled its economy, the Houthis remain in control of most of the country&#x27;s population centres. 
The Guardian&#x27;s Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, explains why a new Houthi offensive could heap more misery on the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire
