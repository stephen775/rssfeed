We’re wrapping up our live US politics coverage for the night, with key political developments still unfolding, including an expected vote on the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate Trump supporters’ invasion of the Capitol on 6 January. 
An updated summary of today’s key news: 
 12.19am BST 
Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether Ukrainian officials attempted to interfere in the 2020 presidential election to undermine Biden and help Trump, including by using Rudolph Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, to spread misinformation, the New York Times reported, citing unnamed sources “with knowledge of the matter”. 
NYT SCOOP: Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Ukrainian officials helped orchestrate a wide-ranging plan to meddle in the 2020 campaign, including using Giuliani to spread misleading claims about Biden and tilt the election in Trump’s favor.https://t.co/7QHFvugPcb
SCOOP: RUDY GIULIANI signed an agreement with ANDRII ARTEMENKO in Nov. 2019 to locate witnesses to defend TRUMP.
One of those witnesses, accused &quot;active Russian agent&quot; ANDRIY DERKACH, later hired Artemenko&#x27;s company to lobby in DC. https://t.co/Rw2ATZ7VOp https://t.co/IWgEa1HXnY

It claimed the banking industry’s approach to reimbursing victims of this type of fraud was “unfair and inconsistent,” with less than half of losses being returned to those affected.

Tens of thousands of homes, offices and hospitals could soon be warmed with surplus heat from factories, incinerator plants and even disused mine shafts under plans by the government to fund low-carbon heating.
The government will spend £30m to help set up heat networks across cities including London, Glasgow and Manchester and a further £14.6m to develop other low-carbon technologies that can heat and cool buildings without fossil fuels.

A burial mound in northern Syria has been identified by researchers as perhaps the world’s oldest known war memorial.
The site, known as the White Monument, in the town of Tal Banat had previously been thought to be an ancient mass grave of enemy fighters. However, a report published in the journal Antiquity on Friday suggests it was a memorial for the community’s battle dead from the 3rd millennium BC.

A study published in the Lancet on Thursday said efforts to curb the habit had been outstripped by population growth with 150 million more people smoking in the nine years from 1990, reaching an all-time high of 1.1 billion.

Goody-bag props, party-hatted fairies and a donkey-shaped piñata sweeten the bard’s dark comedy in a revival of Sean Holmes’s vibrant 2019 production
A donkey-shaped piñata dangles above the stage. It’s a decent metaphor for this play’s colourful, sweet-centred festivities amid destruction. A Midsummer Night’s Dream chimes with lockdown nightmares of confinement and separated lovers, the discombobulation of a world turned upside down and climate chaos. But the Globe throws a party instead, reviving Sean Holmes’s ebullient 2019 Dream, vibrantly designed by Jean Chan, as the venue reopens for the first time since the pandemic hit.
Nicholas Hytner, Dominic Hill and Joe Hill-Gibbins have all recently drawn out the play’s more troubling aspects; here we have bright bursts of dance, brass musicians (from Hackney Colliery Band) who are partial to blasts of Jimi Hendrix, and goody-bag props including bubble guns, water pistols and starry headbands. It’s a fun night, lovably silly with some smart surprises, but doesn’t spin that difficult, delicate web required to let this enchanting play do more than amuse.

Laura Treaster, a spokeswoman for the state parole board, confirmed the decision, which was made on 11 May and first reported on Thursday by Nicole Weisensee Egan, author of the book Chasing Cosby, on her Facebook page.

Maybe we will come to measure out the pandemic in Tulleken time. The identical twin brothers – and practising doctors – Chris and Alexander (Xand) van Tulleken have had a busy year; they have rarely been off our screens for long. Respectively, they are a virologist at University College hospital, London, and an experienced public health doctor with years of experience on the frontline of disaster zones. The pair would doubtless have been commissioned to educate us on Covid – even if Xand hadn’t caught the virus and brought a personal view to the gig (Surviving the Virus: My Brother and Me). Their series Operation Ouch, and other online contributions, helped parents desperately trying to home school, in between fending off unemployment, sourcing supermarket deliveries and caring for shielding parents.
Alone or together, the Van Tullekens are very good at what they do. They turn potentially dark, heavy subjects – primarily, but not always, medical – into lighter, brighter fare, still informed by their in-depth knowledge, but delivered without ego and accessible to a mass audience. In What Are We Feeding Our Kids? (BBC One), we have Chris as a solo act, looking into the health effects – particularly for children – of our increasing consumption of ultra-processed food.

This is the first time the office has filed criminal charges against police officers for unlawful use of deadly force.

                    <span>Analysis: bill is a result of austerity cuts and decisions made by the coalition education secretary

Report: repair bill for schools in England doubles to over £11bn

The £11bn worth of repairs for England’s schools, identified by the Department for Education’s own report, is the accumulated bill that goes back to the decision by Michael Gove to axe an ambitious programme of rebuilding.
The Blair government’s £55bn Building Schools for the Future plan – the biggest programme of its kind since the Victorian era – was a victim of the austerity budgets introduced by the coalition government after 2010, with Gove’s contribution being the abrupt cancellation of building works that were already approved and about to break ground. Some did eventually go ahead, mainly for Gove’s new academies.

After a month of protests in which 46 people have suffered eye injuries from police teargas rounds and rubber bullets, a Colombian politician has prompted outrage by saying that supporters of the anti-poverty demonstrations should “stop crying over one eye”.
“Don’t fool Colombians and don’t fool the international community and stop crying over one eye,” said Paola Holguín, a senator from the ruling Centro Democrático party, to opposition politicians during a virtual floor speech on Wednesday afternoon.

Matt Hancock is under mounting pressure to explain why the government failed to protect care home residents at the outset of the Covid pandemic, as he sought to salvage his reputation after Dominic Cummings accused him of lying.
The health secretary claimed for the first time it “wasn’t possible” to test all care home residents for Covid before they were discharged from hospital last March, because the testing capacity was not yet available.

Analysis: school repair bill goes back to Michael Gove cuts

Schools in England face a repair bill of more than £11bn, nearly double some previous estimates, according to a long-awaited national survey completed by the government.
The survey confirmed years of complaints by teachers and parents of crumbling buildings and leaking facilities, in some cases riddled with asbestos, and of “temporary” cabins that remain in use despite exceeding their lifespan.

In the short history of shareholder activism, the humiliation of the board of ExxonMobil on Wednesday takes some beating. The directors were comprehensively out-played by an environmentally minded hedge fund formed only six months ago that arrived with a stake of only 0.02%.
Despite emerging almost from nowhere, Engine No. 1, the upstart fund, succeeded in persuading other shareholders to vote two of its four candidates on to the board; a third newcomer could follow when the “too close to call” tallies are finally counted. The campaigning achievement is remarkable.

                    <span>What makes Chelsea’s manager so successful? We find out from people who have known him since his school days
Christian Heidel laughs as he remembers a story that sums up Thomas Tuchel’s obsessive attention to detail. “We were in a training camp in Austria and had a match against Olympiakos,” Mainz’s sporting director says. “Thomas was looking closely at the lawn. He was measuring the height, sniffing the grass. He was so thrilled about this pitch that he wanted me to transfer the groundsman to Mainz. The next day the groundsman called me and said: ‘I heard that we’re going to have some talks about a contract.’ The deal didn’t happen but it shows what a perfectionist he is.”
Heidel, who gave Tuchel his break when he put him in charge of Mainz’s first team in 2009, is not the first person to marvel at the Chelsea manager’s quest for perfection. Hans Komm, who taught PE at the German’s Simpert-Kraemer high school, remembers a gifted sportsman who possessed a surprisingly bright tactical mind for a teenager.

                    <span>It could have been a much trickier day for the health secretary, but now he, Tory MPs and the PM are all in this together 
Through a glass darkly. Wasn’t it ironic, said the Conservative William Wragg, that so many Labour MPs who had previously dismissed Dominic Cummings as a Herod were now hailing the prime minister’s former chief adviser as some kind of prophet? Er, maybe ... But it was also noticeable how many Tories, who had once seen Dom as some kind of terrifying, omnipotent genius, were now so quick to denounce him as a fraud. After all, without Cummings there would probably have been no Brexit and no 80-seat majority in the 2019 election.
After Matt Hancock was accused of being a serial liar who should have been sacked on many occasions, Thursday’s urgent question from his Labour shadow, Jon Ashworth, could have made for a tricky hour for the health secretary. Instead it was something of a breeze as Matt was love-bombed by a succession of Tory MPs – the government benches were almost (socially distanced) full, while the opposition benches were nearly empty – who had little interest in mistakes that might have been made in the past. It wasn’t the best of looks when tens of thousands of people may have died unnecessarily, but you couldn’t fault their loyalty.

Up to three-quarters of new UK Covid cases are now thought to be caused by the variant first detected in India, the health secretary has said.
The variant of concern, known as B.1.617.2, has been linked to a rise in cases in hotspots around the country. Data released on Thursday by Public Health England (PHE) shows 6,959 cases have been confirmed so far in the UK, up from 3,424 the week before.

So-called umbrella companies, used by recruiters and employers to pay temporary workers, have attracted growing scrutiny from MPs and unions following reports of abuses across the industry and investigations by the Guardian and the BBC that raised concerns about agencies supplying the NHS test-and-trace scheme.

A driver waiting to start his shift at Heckmondwike bus station, West Yorkshire, neither Jowett nor his colleague Trevor Lewis, 55, had much sympathy for the prime minister’s former adviser.
“But, if it’s true, there’s got to be an investigation, because there’s a lot of families up and down the country that won’t be happy,” Lewis added.

“One day I’m in, one day I’m out, then I’m a bit in, then we draw or lose and I’m out again,” Zinedine Zidane said. That was early February and it is also part of the reason why, almost four months later, he really is out. On Thursday morning, around 10.30, the Real Madrid manager drove into Valdebebas. By the time he drove back out two hours later, he was officially the former Real Madrid manager. Again. He had told some players the night before, around the time footage appeared of the Santiago Bernabéu on fire.
The statement from the club confirming his departure was released just after midday. It was polite without being especially effusive and only 102 words long. There are no plans for a press conference or a farewell; the club’s media chose to turn the page, the statement followed by studied silence. The only player Zidane could say goodbye to in person was Lucas Vázquez, undergoing his rehabilitation at Valdebebas.

As Warner Brothers still tries to repair the ungodly mess that is the DC cinematic universe (a scrappy hack job of false starts, recasts, cursed sets and confusing timelines), the studio has strangely found more sustained success and structural consistency with another interlinked set of movies from a genre not traditionally associated with this form of brash expansion. With The Conjuring franchise, Warners has turned a sleeper hit into a series of seven and a half films over eight years, totalling almost $2bn at the global box office, unprecedented for the horror genre and as creaky as the films might have gotten, it’s an impressive and revealing case study on how to turn very little into a lot.

                    <span>Analysis: Scientists agree with the former adviser’s claim, with one calling the estimate ‘conservative’

Coronavirus – latest updates

One of the most shocking allegations made by Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings during Wednesday’s joint parliamentary committee hearing was his claim that “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die”, because of the way the government handled the Covid pandemic.
His claims have some support from scientists, who have estimated that the toll from government delays could be as high as 33,000 lives.

                    <span>Dominic Cummings’ charges have strengthened the case for the official public inquiry into coronavirus to be brought forward from next year
Faced with Dominic Cummings’ fusillade against Boris Johnson’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the government on Thursday circled the wagons. As a short-term expedient, it made grubby tactical sense. The Conservative party believes public feeling is on its side because of the vaccination programme. Mr Cummings is mistrusted because of the Barnard Castle debacle. The former Downing Street adviser has not yet published the documents that may corroborate his claims. This added up to a window of opportunity for ministers to dismiss the allegations as false or unsubstantiated, and for Tory MPs to put on a display of unity behind the health secretary, Matt Hancock.
It was not, though, a morally dignified exercise, especially in the light of Mr Cummings’ grave claims that tens of thousands of British people died unnecessarily because of the government’s failures and that Mr Johnson is not fit to be prime minister. In political terms, it may not be a sustainable position either. The charges levelled on Thursday by Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth were substantive and serious. Fourteen months ago, Mr Hancock promised a protective shield around care homes; yet 30,000 care home residents died. He promised extensive supplies of personal protective equipment; yet up to 8,700 patients and 850 health workers died after contracting the virus in hospitals. These shocking facts are not going to go away.

                    <span>The families’ determination made them a beacon for other campaigners. But while they forced the truth into the open, the courts let them down
The families of the 96 people unlawfully killed at Hillsborough as a result of gross negligence by the police fought for justice for more than three decades. The collapse of the trial of two former police officers and a solicitor, after a judge ruled that the men had no case to answer, marks a cruel end to one of the bravest and longest-lasting of all British justice campaigns. The institutions that between them make up the policing and legal system should be deeply ashamed. First, Hillsborough’s victims and survivors were blamed. Now, they have been let down yet again.
There have been many individual and organisational failures over the years, beginning with inadequate planning by the police and others for the FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield on 15 April 1989. The media, specifically the Sun newspaper which joined in with police efforts to smear the victims, 37 of whom were teenagers, are implicated in some of these.

The 44-year-old, who was a well-known broadcaster in the north-east of England and had worked for BBC Radio Newcastle since 2015, developed severe headaches a week after having the jab and fell seriously ill a few days later, relatives said in a statement.

Towards the end of last season, not long after players had returned from lockdown, the Frenchman Gaël Monfils continued to embrace his newfound hobby on the streaming website Twitch. After retiring from a match in October, he decided to skip his mandatory post-match press duties in favour of inviting French journalists to conduct the press conference online for his fans.
The journalists were left with a choice – attend the press conference on terms dictated by Monfils or potentially miss out. In the end, those who did attend discussed with him his biggest news of the year: he was shutting down his season.

The UN’s main human rights body will launch an investigation into “systematic discrimination and repression” in Israel and Palestine, with the aim of identifying what it said were the root causes of recent Gaza bloodshed.
The proposal for unprecedented levels of scrutiny of alleged abuses, called at the request of Muslim states, was passed by the 47-member UN human rights council on Thursday.

The case dates back to 2008, when the woman, a student, 22 at the time, claimed she had been raped by seven men in Florence.

                    <span>Readers on the former No 10 adviser’s revelations about the incompetence of the government in handling the Covid crisis

It is astonishing that it has taken so long for self-styled superbrain Dominic Cummings to figure out that the man he put into No 10 is “unfit for the job” (Report, 26 May). The rest of us have been painfully aware of this for many years, and never more so than over the last 18 months. While Cummings’ testimony was full of sanctimonious bile and he is not known for his honesty, as long as Boris Johnson refuses to initiate a timely public inquiry this may be the best opportunity we get to see behind the curtain and reveal the mishandling of the pandemic by this “confederacy of dunces” led by Johnson and Cummings.

When the Guardian archive was first made available online, my mother and I took the opportunity to look up some ancestors. One obituary we discovered was that of the Rev John Aldis (6 December 1900). We were a little confused: hadn’t he lived a few years longer? Still, we were delighted to discover the obituary. Even better was to find a correction in the next edition – the obituary had been published in error; the death had been of his son (also the Rev John Aldis). The Rev John Aldis Sr lived until 1907, dying at the age of 99, but I have no record if the obituary was republished.

• It was inspiring to see wonderful images of Sophie Matterson’s ongoing and hugely impressive walk (Outback camel trek: one woman’s 5,000km journey across Australia, 25 May) and I wish her well. However, it’s remarkable that the image captions did not once reference the pioneering Robyn Davidson, who made just such a journey and wrote about it in her award-winning book Tracks (1980). This is mentioned not to diminish Matterson’s achievement but rather to create a lineage of women’s achievements in their own terms. Memory is central to this process and amplifies, rather than reduces, what follows.

What should we do about Belarus? It is becoming the North Korea of Europe, its opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, told the European parliament this week. But it must be the wrong question. The question is not what should we do, but what can we do?
European and American politicians reach for economic sanctions as they used to reach for gunboats or bombers. But gunboats meant results. You soon knew if anything had changed. Sanctions are like papal edicts, signals of moral superiority supposedly cost-free to the signaller.

Ole Gunnar Solskjær wants to strengthen Manchester United in the centre-back, midfield, wide attacker and No 9 positions, with Pau Torres, Declan Rice, Jadon Sancho and Harry Kane among his preferred targets.
Although the manager is conscious that adding four major signings is unlikely given an estimated total cost of more than £300m and the availability of any particular player, he is intent at least on pursuing one in each of his identified areas to bolster a squad that requires an upgrade in quality and depth.

Now, scientists have created the largest ever map of this mysterious substance – and it could imply that there’s something wrong with Einstein’s theory of relativity.

                    <span>Unmarried mothers were treated with contempt by authorities in the mid-20th century. The same goes for people deemed not to matter today
When Ann Keen gave birth, the midwives refused to give her anything for the pain. That way, they told her, she would remember it and learn not to be so wicked again. To be treated like an animal in labour, denied the most basic compassion and respect, was simply part of the punishment she had supposedly earned for getting pregnant out of wedlock aged 17. The hospital discharged her without any follow-up care, as if the birth had never happened. But the most grievous part of the story is that she also went home without her baby.
For Keen is one of a still unknown number of unmarried British women coerced into handing over their newborns for adoption between the 1950s and the late 1970s, who are now seeking an apology from Boris Johnson on behalf of the governments of the day. But perhaps just as importantly, they want it acknowledged that they didn’t give their children up willingly. Some were told that if they loved their babies they would want them raised by respectable married couples, not under the shadow of illegitimacy.

                    <span>Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Driss Oukabir and Said Ben Iazza jailed over attacks that left 16 people dead and 140 wounded
Three men have been jailed for between eight and 53 years after being found guilty of assisting the perpetrators of the 2017 terror attacks in Catalonia, which left 16 people dead and 140 wounded.
The men who carried out the atrocities – Spain’s worst terror attack since the Madrid train bombings in March 2004 – used a van to knock down pedestrians on Barcelona’s La Rambla boulevard on 17 August 2017 and then staged another assault the following day in the Catalan coastal town of Cambrils.

                    <span>The sheer number of rare conditions Dr Turner and the midwives of Nonnatus House diagnose would warrant a Nobel prize – and are making the series as silly as Midsomer Murders
If television were the real world, no one would want to live in the global homicide hotspot of Midsomer. Every woman, though, would beg to be a patient at Nonnatus House clinic in Poplar, East London, because the standard of healthcare is so extraordinary.
So far in season 10 of Call the Midwife, which concludes on Sunday, Dr Patrick Turner (Stephen McGann) and his team of midwives have diagnosed a case of gestational diabetes, a condition little understood at the dramatised time of 1966, and a very rare enzyme disorder, phenylketonuria.

The world needs to quadruple its annual investment in nature if the climate, biodiversity and land degradation crises are to be tackled by the middle of the century, according to a new UN report.
Investing just 0.1% of global GDP every year in restorative agriculture, forests, pollution management and protected areas to close a $4.1tn (£2.9tn) financial gap by 2050 could avoid the breakdown of natural ecosystem “services” such as clean water, food and flood protection, the report said.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I reread Mrs Dalloway. I wasn’t the only one – something about the novel seemed to resonate; as Evan Kindley noted in the New Yorker last April, the spectre of Spanish flu hangs subtly but perceptibly over it. I had first read it as a student – probably, on reflection, mere months before a terrible thing would happen to me, during which I expected I would die. This event changed the configuration of my mind and, in myriad unforeseeable ways, my entire life. It also, it turns out, changed the way in which I’d read Mrs Dalloway. Its portrayal of a shell-shocked mind, which I had noted but not fully appreciated before, seems all the more authentic, visceral.

A “cataclysmic day” for three major oil companies in which investors rebelled over climate fears and a court ordered fossil fuel emissions to be slashed has sparked hope among campaigners, investors, lawyers and academics who said the historic decisions marked a turning point in efforts to tackle the climate crisis.
A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered Shell to cut carbon emissions from its oil and gas by 45% by 2030. A tiny activist investor group simultaneously won two places on ExxonMobil’s board and Chevron’s management was defeated when investors voted in favour of forcing the group to cut its carbon emissions.

An independent panel found that Roberts had made repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff, as well as inappropriate comments of a sexual nature.

British participation in at the Cannes film festival is under threat after new quarantine regulations put into place by the French government as the country seeks to successfully exit lockdown.
After delays caused by Covid, the festival confirmed it would take place in early July, but France has announced a seven-day isolation period for visitors from the UK in response to rising concerns over the Covid variant B.1.617.2, first detected in India. The move is likely to affect thousands, both among the press corps and industry delegates, and large numbers of unregistered attendees.

There was a time the very thought of Cruella would have been met with outrage. I know this because I would have been outraged. Of all subcultures to be hijacked by Disney, 70s London wasteland punk is surely the most heinous.
Now? Well, what punk could even mean in 2021 is open to offers. While Disney releases Cruella – a pop blockbuster filtered through $200m of corporate compromise – Danny Boyle is making Pistol, a TV adaptation of the memoir of the Sex Pistols’ Steve Jones. And yes, one of these instinctively feels more punk than the other. And yes, it is Cruella.

The New York rapper, who died in April, is strong and unsettling over grimy, atonal production, with guest turns from Alicia Keys, Jay-Z and Bono
Hip-hop loves a posthumous album, but DMX’s has arrived sooner than most because it wasn’t supposed to be posthumous at all. Earl Simmons’ career had been in decline since the mid-00s, eventually grinding to a halt amid a litany of legal problems, health issues and financial woes – he filed for bankruptcy three times, was jailed for everything from tax fraud to animal cruelty; struggled with bipolar disorder and addiction and released only one, poorly received official album, 2012’s Undisputed, in the last 15 years. But prior to his death from an apparent drug overdose this April, he was already on the comeback trail.

The high court in Belfast awarded the record figure on Thursday to vindicate and compensate Foster, the outgoing leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), for what it said was a baseless accusation.

Activists believe as many as 20,000 garimpeiro prospectors are operating within the Yanomami reserve in northern Brazil using speedboats and light aircraft to penetrate the vast expanse of jungle near the border with Venezuela.

Eric Carle, who has died aged 91, was best known as the author-illustrator of The Very Hungry Caterpillar, a deceptively simple 16-page picture book whose original production and story not only entranced very young children with the most arresting “pop!” in literature but also provided entertainment and satisfaction for their parents.
Like many who have an exceptional success, Carle did not like to be acknowledged for the one title only. He was quick and sometimes testy in pointing out that he had created many other books, too – more than 70. But with its adaptability to different formats and the slew of merchandising that sees his character on everything from a pencil to a tea service, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, a “modern classic” that has sold more than 55m copies around the world, remains his biggest legacy. As Carle himself quite happily recalled in an interview, “So much from so little, as one of my friends once put it.”

                    <span>As the disastrous decisions outlined by Dominic Cummings were made, the opposition and many journalists showed only support

Ten days before England locked down too late to prevent tens of thousands of deaths, a senior government official waltzed into No 10 to prophetically declare: “I think we are absolutely fucked. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we’re going to kill thousands of people.” In a functioning democracy, you might expect senior journalists briefed by No 10 to have at least questioned what was glaringly obvious to those at the very top – that Britain was disastrously ill-equipped and ill-prepared for a pandemic already sweeping the country.

Antonio Conte open to discussions after leaving Inter

Tottenham have held talks with Mauricio Pochettino over a sensational return to the club. Pochettino, sacked by Spurs 18 months ago, joined Paris Saint-Germain in January and has caused surprise by entertaining the idea of a swift return to London.
The Argentinian is believed to be interested in reviving his former club, who have encountered frustration in their attempts to replace José Mourinho, and the previously ridiculous notion of a reunion could come to pass.

Challenging yourself on an outdoor adventure and overcoming fears, be they of heights, injury or humiliation, is an important rite of passage for older children and teenagers, and a great way to boost self-confidence and resilience. And with many school activity trips cancelled for the second year running, here are some ideas for parents looking to plug that gap off their own back. The kind of transformative experiences kids can only have when they get out into the elements and leave their bedrooms and comfort zones behind.

                    <span>My parents have been eating pheasants killed on the roads for years and encouraging me to try them. Is this the most ethical approach to meat-eating?
Motorists shoot me funny looks as I sheepishly cross a scrubby verge, trying my best to conceal the dead pheasant under my arm. I am in a part of Saddleworth Moor called the Isle of Skye by locals, and have just collected a free meal from the middle of the road.
Nobody can agree on how this area of moorland, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, earned its nickname. Some think it comes from a Victorian navvy, who exclaimed in a broad Irish brogue: “Look, there’s an ’ole in the sky,” as he considered a parting in the thick mist above him. Others think it was named after an inn of the same name. But either way, the area should be immediately renamed Pheasant Cemetery. Because, before I picked up my own bird, I counted 46 pheasant carcasses in various stages of decomposition, scattered and splattered on the road over several miles as I drove to Holmfirth for a day out.

Jane Gilbert, who has been tasked by Miami-Dade county with coordinating and accelerating efforts to protect lives from extreme heat, said that more focus was needed on what has been called the “silent killer” of the climate crisis.

                    <span>Boxing must address the damage done in the ring and a new book by Tris Dixon lays out what’s left after the final bell rings
The writer, the fighter, the doctor and the widow all look down into the darkness and damage of boxing. They understand the previously untold story of brain trauma in the ring and, as they talk to me, their moving testimony underpins a shared belief that change has to come. There is a measured urgency to their words for they love the fighters and they want to offer their knowledge to help make this brutal sport a little safer.
Damage and death have always framed boxing. This harsh truth means that, despite the chaos outside the ring, boxing is shockingly real. It can maim and even kill but, in a strange paradox, boxing also makes most fighters feel more intensely alive than anything else.

                    <span>Scores baffle us but we can’t find out how it arrived at them
When my wife and I bought our first car, the lowest insurance offers involved black boxes to track our driving. We went with Bell, part of the Admiral Group, which promised personalised driving advice, no curfews and tracking for only six months, unless your ratings are in the bottom 5%. We estimated we would travel 10 miles a day, including a margin for the occasional big trip. Usually, it’s nearer 12 miles a week. The manufacturer feedback from my car tells me my speed, braking and anticipation average 85%, but Bell’s first two assessments, after a few months driving no more than four miles a day, gave me an average score of 43% and advised I use the car less.
My third assessment, after driving an extra seven miles to a hospital appointment, scored 35%, with my driving style rated at 19%. Again, I was told to use the car less. Bell’s website gives no detail about how it arrives at the numbers. Its feedback has doubled the number of hours I’ve spent behind the wheel, misinterpreted “direct routes” available, and shrunk my average speed to 3.52mph.

                    <span>Supporters of a new coalmine have argued that it will reduce global warming and create green jobs. How could such absurd claims have gained any credibility? 
It was in early 2019 that I first heard about the proposals for a new coalmine in Cumbria. It happened almost by chance. I was speaking with a local government officer who was developing the county’s economic strategy. As someone who has worked with governments on climate issues for many years, I had been asked to offer advice on how to make Cumbria a climate leader. We talked through the opportunities – investing in renewables, helping businesses reduce waste, developing Cumbria’s tourist industry.
And then the government officer mentioned, almost in passing, that they had been helping a company with plans for a new coalmine, to produce coking coal for steel production. I didn’t know what to say. This would be the first new deep coal mine in the UK for 30 years, and the only active one: the last of the old ones closed in 2015. After a long silence I pointed out that digging up coal – the most polluting of all fossil fuels – is no definition of climate leadership. Yet just a couple of weeks later, Cumbria county council’s planning committee voted unanimously in favour of the mine.

                    <span>For many years, the actor and director’s behaviour was seemingly unchallenged. But there are hopes that the recent claims against him could help spur positive change

After 20 women came forward to tell the Guardian they had been sexually harassed and bullied by the actor, director, screenwriter and producer Noel Clarke, the question on many people’s lips was: did other people in the industry know about this? And if not, why not?
While some of the incidents of harassment or bullying took place without witnesses, others happened in front of colleagues and senior production staff. The assistant film director Anna Avramenko, who worked as an intern on the film Doghouse in 2008, told the Guardian that Clarke approached her on set and “started trying to kiss me on the lips, in front of everyone”. She added: “He probably tried it like three to five times with me, maybe more.”

                    <span>Despite attempts to drive her out of the church, she has spent decades fighting racism wherever she has encountered it. Now she is pushing the C of E to honour the enslaved people it exploited
Soon after she became the first Black female vicar in the Church of England in the 80s, the Rev Eve Pitts walked into a bar. She had finished theological college at the Queen’s Foundation in Birmingham and had just received her first posting, in Bartley Green, Birmingham. The area was notoriously unwelcoming to minorities, with a strong far-right presence (in 2019, a neo-Nazi living in Bartley Green was jailed for three years under the Terrorism Act). When Pitts took up her post at Saint Michael and All Angels’ church, in 1987, she remembers seeing graffiti with “‘National Front’, ‘niggers go home’, all over the place”.
Her training vicar was worried enough to advise Pitts against going into the local pub. Looking back, Pitts laughs, “he obviously didn’t know me!” Instead, one night the young, diminutive Pitts walked in, past men who looked like “archetypal” neo-Nazis, with “tattoos all over their hands”, marched up to the bar and asked: “So, who’s going to buy me a drink, then?”

                    <span>Former aide lashed out at every aspect of the government’s approach and Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock in particular
Dominic Cummings spent an hours-long session in parliament on Wednesday giving evidence to a joint committee on the government’s response to the Covid pandemic. He took aim at Boris Johnson for overseeing a chaotic response and at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, for what he alleged was lying over preparedness and PPE stocks.
Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff tells Anushka Asthana that it was the first chance to get a detailed firsthand account of what was going on in the heart of government as the crisis unfolded. But how much should Cummings himself be seen as culpable for the failures?

I picked this image because it’s one of only a few where I got to know the people in the photograph. I usually take a fly-on-the-wall approach, observing groups at a distance. I’m interested in exploring how people kick back, and most of my projects are connected by leisure and contemporary culture. I did a series called Bachelorette, documenting the cultural ritual of bachelorette parties, as a night of release for women. Another looked at the nightlife in Manhattan’s high-gloss Meatpacking district – a microcosm of sexual politics. But I didn’t interact with the people in those pictures or get their names.

EU citizens living and working in the UK are being met with suspicion and in some cases refused entry at the UK border for the first time in their lives, after the implementation of new post-Brexit rules and the lifting of Covid travel restrictions. 
Chloe, a pastry chef from Denmark, tells Anushka Asthana that, because she could not produce a return ticket, she was denied entry at Calais to the UK recently and forced to make the long drive back to Denmark. It is becoming a familiar story, with other EU citizens reporting hostility from officials and some being held at immigration detention centres.

                    <span>A year ago, the murder of George Floyd caused outrage in Minneapolis – and kicked off a protest movement that spread across the world. How do the young Black people at the heart of the story live with his legacy?
A year after George Floyd was murdered, the movement instigated by his death has spread across the US and the world, but Black people in Minneapolis are still living with the emotional fallout from that day. Anushka Asthana speaks to Amudalat Ajasa, who was still a student when she heard the news and marched in protest against police brutality against Black people before becoming a Guardian contributor earlier this year. Amudalat looks back on how the crisis has changed her sense of her city and why she felt compelled to document the movement as it took shape.
They also discuss Amudalat’s interview with Chris Martin, the 19-year-old Black man who sold George Floyd a packet of cigarettes and then watched in disbelief as he died on the sidewalk outside. He told how he wrestled with a sense of guilt over his decision to report that the $20 bill Floyd used to pay might be fake, and reflected on how the guilty verdicts after he testified at Derek Chauvin’s trial helped him understand he bore no responsibility.

The Guardian&#x27;s Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, explains why a new Houthi offensive could heap more misery on the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire
