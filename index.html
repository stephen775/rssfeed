The Algerian coastguard has seized almost half a tonne of cocaine after fishers alerted authorities to “suspicious” items floating off the north-west coast.
The coastguard fished out 490kg (1,080 pounds) of cocaine split up into 442 packages from the water six nautical miles (11 kilometres) off Oran’s Cap Carbon on Saturday evening, a defence ministry statement said on Monday.

Footage has emerged online apparently showing Prof Chris Whitty being accosted in public, with the vaccine minister calling for the “thugs” to face charges.
The video, which has been shared on social media, seems to show the chief medical officer struggling to get away as the people filming in selfie mode appear to manhandle him.

In a significant blow to US regulators’ attempt to rein in big tech, a federal judge has dismissed lawsuits brought against Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission and a broad coalition of state attorneys general.
The US government and 48 states and districts sued Facebook in December 2020, accusing the tech company of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors and seeking remedies that could include a forced spin-off of the social network’s Instagram and WhatsApp messaging services.

                    <span>The latest lineup of buff beauties are in the villa, with added mental health measures and more reasons to question yourself for viewing. But try not to dwell – let the nonsense commence!
I don’t know. I don’t know. If I had to bring in stringent checks on people’s mental health and resilience, if I had to ensure that a ‘welfare team’ was on set at all times during filming, provide ongoing psychological support plus social media training for those leaving, and ensure the screen was plastered with infographics begging viewers to “Think before they post” to try to mitigate the onslaught of online abuse that previous series of this and similar shows are proven to elicit, I might … pause for thought.
All these measures and more have been brought in by the makers of the phenomenal hit Love Island, as it returns for its seventh series, because of its bleak history. That includes contestants becoming the victims of revenge porn and death threats after their appearances, criticism from the charity Women’s Aid for the treatment of female contestants by “controlling” and “abusive” male participants and, most notably, the deaths by suicide of two contestants and its host for five series, Caroline Flack.

The Rev Richard Coles has called for more realistic and less glamourised depictions of alcoholism on TV as he recalled his late husband’s battle with excessive drinking that led to his death.
Coles, a vicar in Northamptonshire, said there was a need to restore “realism to a distorted picture” of “how we poison ourselves” for fear of romanticising a debilitating disease.

                    <span>The director’s pulpy novelisation of his most recent film is entirely outrageous and addictively readable
Quentin Tarantino made a career alchemising movie trash into gold: with a connoisseur’s ecstasy, he worked with B-movie language and grindhouse rhetoric. Now he’s done the same with a genre the literary world wrinkles its nose at, the pulpiest of pulp fiction – the novelisation. This is normally the lowliest kind of movie brand promotion, which had its heyday before the VHS age, targeted at film fans who wanted a way to relive the experience.
Tarantino has turned his most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, into a novel: messing with the timeline, cranking up the backstories, mulching up reality and alt.reality pastiche, ladling in new episodes. The result comes packaged in something like those New English Library paperbacks that used to be on carousel displays in supermarkets and drugstores. In the endpapers he cheekily includes ads for old commercial paperbacks real and imagined, such as Erich Segal’s Oliver’s Story, sequel to Love Story (“Soon to be a major motion picture”).

Employer discrimination is holding back second-generation African, Caribbean and Asian people in the jobs market even though they tend to be more highly educated, according to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
People of that background whose parents emigrated to Britain were far more likely to get a university degree than their white British peers, but they faced much higher unemployment rates overall. However, the report also showed that once in employment, they tended to be more upwardly mobile and were more likely to be in professional or managerial jobs.

The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said he wants a ban on mobile phones as he launched a consultation on pupil behaviour and discipline in schools. He said he wanted to make the school day “mobile-free” to help ensure that classrooms remain calm and pupils can overcome the impact of the pandemic.

In an 8-3 decision on Monday, the court ruled that sections of the country’s general health law prohibiting personal consumption and home cultivation of marijuana were unconstitutional.

Speaking at his first virtual fundraiser since the 2020 election, the former Democratic president said former Republican president’s claims undermined the legitimacy of US elections and helped lead to other anti-democratic measures such as efforts to suppress the vote.

That is why he was fifth in their list of penalty takers and is why, when he stepped up to keep them in Euro 2020, the thought he might miss felt like too heady a twist in the narrative. Things like that have simply not happened to Mbappé during a young career of rare accomplishment, but here came the kind of horror that exposes even the preternaturally gifted as flesh-and-blood mortals: Yann Sommer, Switzerland’s exceptional goalkeeper, smelled weakness and read his intentions correctly, diving right and clawing the spot-kick away. France were out; their delirious opponents had made their own slice of history and a tournament of unstinting drama took its least plausible turn yet.

Manuel Neuer says team will take knee to ‘show solidarity’

Joachim Löw will be forced into late fitness calls on Ilkay Gündogan, Antonio Rüdiger and Robin Gosens before Germany’s last-16 meeting with England at Wembley on Tuesday. The trio, ordinarily starters, were among the party that arrived in London on Monday but doubts remain over their availability.
Löw explained Rüdiger and Gosens are suffering from “small infections” and “tiredness” which the coach likened to a cold, with Gündogan seeking to shake off a head injury. “We decide with the doctors on match day,” said Löw. “Maybe they [Rüdiger and Gosens] will get up and feel well but maybe it will get worse overnight so we need to wait. I don’t know if these three will be at our disposal, I cannot say that. But [if not] we will have other solutions.”

                    <span>MPs pile in to celebrate his appointment, and you can see their point, he’s definitely preferable to Hancock
The rumour was that Matt Hancock’s departure became inevitable when the rest of the frontbench refused to go out and support him. Even so, it felt a bit iffy that, of a few words mangled by Sajid Javid, in his first performance as the new health secretary, the first was the prefix “honourable” to the MP for West Suffolk. Dude, nobody’s asking you to go out and bat for the man. You just have to get the letters in the right order.
It was a performance with a difference from Javid, the difference being that he basically said “yes” to everything. Where it wasn’t a yes, it was a hard confirm. He was the TSB of health secretaries, the man who says yes not because you’re his brother-in-law but because he likes to. It will unfold over time what this pile-up of yessing actually means – will he give NHS staff a pay rise? Yes, it will certainly be a “fair” settlement – but before he greeted thirty brisk questions in the affirmative (a pass for Richard Burgon’s, but we’ll come to that), there was the business of his speech.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The UK’s biggest business lobby group has called on the government to relax post-Brexit immigration rules to help companies struggling with staff shortages to hire more workers from overseas.
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the government needed to immediately update its “shortage occupations list” to include several areas where employers are finding it difficult to recruit staff, including butchers, bricklayers and welders.

                    <span>Labour calls for nationalisation of process of fixing high-rise flats to eliminate administration fees
Property agents stand to earn hundreds of millions of pounds by charging administration fees on works to make buildings safe after the Grenfell Tower fire, Labour has said, as it urged the government to nationalise the process of making high-rise flats safe.
Managing agents of tower blocks caught up in the building safety crisis are charging fees of around 4% on multimillion-pound works to fix cladding and combustible walls on thousands of homes. With the government having pledged £5.1bn for the works so far, the opposition has estimated that the fees on publicly funded repairs could reach £200m, with more charged on additional safety bills to be met from leaseholders’ own pockets.

In the four years since Andy Murray last won a singles match at Wimbledon, the two-times champion has been to sporting hell and back, battered by constant doubt and injury setbacks in a career that seemed to have reached its end so many times. But at no point during his toils did he ever lose his will to succeed and he continues to do all he can in service of that goal.
Back in the Wimbledon singles draw once more, Murray took an invaluable step forward as he defeated Nikoloz Basilashvili, the 24th seed, 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 to reach the second round.

The Welsh first minister has launched a fierce attack on the UK government’s attitude to the devolved nations, accusing it of favouring “flag flying” over constructive thinking and acting in an “aggressively unilateral way”.
Mark Drakeford argued that it was time for relations between Westminster and the devolved governments to be reset to protect the “fragile” union, and called for Wales to be allowed to take control of its own legal system and policing.

A statement late on Monday said the two works were in the hands of the police, but provided no detail on their condition and on whether any arrests had been made.

“Gareth Southgate, the whole of England is with you!” Is it, though? As Southgate prepares to send his injury-free, defensively unbreached, quietly purposeful England team into the last-16 tie against Germany on Tuesday night, two things stand out.
First, it is hard to recall such a talented, well-set England team approaching a tournament knockout tie so grudgingly praised in their own country. Welcome to England 2021, a place where even the football feels a little seasick right now. And second, like it or not, rail against the simplicity, draw attention instead to the process if you must – but this is a moment that will define the progress of Southgate’s England.

Hundreds of thousands of pupils will no longer have to automatically isolate after contact with a positive Covid case when schools return in September in England, ministers are expected to announce.
A quarter of a million children missed school in a single week because of coronavirus infections, self-isolation or school closures this month – the most disrupted week since schools fully reopened across the country in March.

The kind of match that left many questions, including: how do you explain it? Where do you even start with this?
With the score: 5-3? With the 35 shots? With the fact that Spain won, securing a place in the quarter-final? Or the fact that they had to win twice? With Croatia’s implausible revival? With the noise, the occasion, the nerves? With the quality, and there was plenty of that? With the heart, of which there was even more? With the silliness, because there was some of that too? How about with the goal that ultimately brought this to an end perhaps, finally carrying Spain through a storm?

Burberry boss Marco Gobbetti to step down after five years
Partnership ends that kept Burberry at leading cultural edge

Marco Gobbetti was hired by Burberry to solve one boardroom crisis – the uncomfortable reign as chief executive of Christopher Bailey, who was clearly better suited to being the creative boss. By skipping off early, though, he’s caused another. Burberry doesn’t have a succession plan, as far as one can tell, which is not ideal when the UK’s leading fashion house is persistently talked about as a takeover candidate.
You could see Burberry’s discomfort in its effort to describe Gobbetti’s time as “nearly” five years with the company. It depends on how you count it. He became chief executive almost exactly four years ago after a six-month warm-up tour of Asia. More relevantly, he launched his five-year plan in November 2017, so, even if he stays until the end of this year, he will have overseen only four years of a five-year overhaul, which is not quite a full lap of the catwalk.

Labour was criticised for distributing a flyer to Muslim voters showing Boris Johnson with India’s nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, in 2019, along with the message: “Don’t risk a Tory MP who is not on your side.”

The British &amp; Irish Lions have arrived safely in South Africa but uncertainty still hangs over their tour itinerary, with rising Covid-19 infection rates in the province of Gauteng prompting increasing concern. The possibility of staging the majority of the tour games, and potentially all three Tests, in Cape Town is under discussion, although South African officials remain keen to stick to the existing schedule.
Every precaution is being taken to ensure the tour can proceed safely, with the Lions’ hand luggage being carefully sprayed with disinfectant at Johannesburg airport, but the Lions are not yet absolutely sure if they will be staying put in Gauteng for their opening three tour fixtures next month.

                    <span>World No 1 Djokovic wins 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in first round
British 19-year-old shows glimpse of his future potential

Jack Draper was milling around Wimbledon’s practice courts at Aorangi Park on Friday morning, unaware that the draw was taking place, when the 19-year-old caught a glimpse of his name in the top section and realised his first ever grand slam match would be against Novak Djokovic, the best player in the world, on the most famous court in the country.
Any kind of tension or trepidation would be completely understandable for an unproven teenager who has barely even had the chance to compete against top 100 players, yet he fearlessly embraced the moment and clearly demonstrated his talent. Eventually, Djokovic reeled in the world number 253 and moved on in four comfortable sets 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.

A man who won a “solid gold” can of BrewDog beer has been left disappointed after the prize, which the Scottish brewery claims is worth £15,000, turned out to be largely made of brass.
BrewDog and its chief executive, James Watt, advertised the chance to win the can across multiple media platforms between November 2020 and March 2021, as part of a promotional competition.

                    <span>The prime minister wants no one in his cabinet to pay for their mistakes, a strategy that has failed

The departure of Matt Hancock from the cabinet is not the end of the matter. It may only be the beginning. Boris Johnson swiftly appointed former chancellor Sajid Javid to replace Mr Hancock, who resigned a day after pictures showing him kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo at work in breach of the government’s social distancing regulations. Yet the whole business raises questions about how government works, who it is in office to serve and risks eroding confidence in public health measures.
In breaking his own pandemic rules Mr Hancock diminished the public’s willingness to adhere to lockdown guidelines. He thought he could apologise and move on. But clearly nothing less than his resignation would restore trust in the government’s ability to manage the pandemic, which is vital as it underpins public attitudes and behaviours. There is such a thing as trust and respect in politics. They make a difference, despite Mr Johnson setting no store by them.

Nissan is expected to promise to build as many as 200,000 batteries for electric vehicles every year in the UK, in partnership with Chinese specialist Envision AESC.

                    <span>A record-low turnout was bad news for Marine Le Pen, but should also be a cause for wider concern
The morning after the final round of France’s regional elections, the two most likely contenders for the Élysée in next year’s presidential elections were left licking their wounds. Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) had the worst night, failing to win any of five regions it had targeted – some of them with high hopes of victory. President Emmanuel Macron’s party, La République En Marche, also failed to win anywhere and remains a phantasmagorical presence in the country at large. For a grassroots movement set up five years ago to renew politics, polling at around 7% is not a good look. The big winner of the night was the centre-right Republican, Xavier Bertrand, whose presidential ambitions have been considerably boosted by an impressive victory in the northern region of Hauts-de-France. A Macron-Le Pen run off next spring is not the foregone conclusion it once seemed.
Perhaps the most eye-catching statistic of all, however, was the turnout figure. The overwhelming, runaway winner of these polls was the unofficial stay-at-home party. Less than 35% of those eligible to vote opted to do so – a record low and only a fraction above last week’s first-round vote (also a record). Among 18- to 24-year-olds, close to 90% may have ignored the elections, while a huge majority of under-35s also found something better to do.

Womad festival has been cancelled for the second year in a row, with the co-founder Peter Gabriel blaming the government’s refusal to provide insurance support for festivals and a lack of clarity on how large-scale events should proceed after the proposed lockdown easing on 19 July.
“We feel that our audience, artists, staff and contractors, who have been amazingly supportive throughout all this, will understand the need for us to act to guarantee our survival,” Gabriel said in a statement.

The Guardian can also reveal a number of emails were copied into Lord Bethell’s private email account. His address was copied into at least four official exchanges relating to a businessman who was attempting to get government contracts during the pandemic.

England’s poorest areas left far behind with lack of social infrastructure

With its sand dunes and sprawling beach, the ward of Yarmouth North in Great Yarmouth does not at first glance appear to be somewhere that fits the tag of “left-behind neighbourhood” that it has been given in a study of England’s poorest areas.
The analysis, conducted by Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion of public assets in the worst-off council wards, found that left-behind neighbourhoods on average have a disproportionate lack of social infrastructure in comparison with the national average.

‘We have plenty’: community spaces study is disputed in Yarmouth North

England’s poorest neighbourhoods have by far the biggest shortages of basic social infrastructure such as parks, playgrounds, pubs, shops and sports facilities – and are least likely to get government funding to renew their community, a study has found.
An audit of public assets in the 10% worst-off council wards – known as “left behind neighbourhoods” – found they had disproportionately fewer public spaces and buildings, and were less than half as likely to have charities and community groups in their local area.

                    <span>As the end of the financial year looms, many Australians turn their eyes to charitable giving. Here,  professionals in the field suggest how to make donations that count
Just over a decade ago, Peter Singer issued a fundamental challenge to the relatively wealthy world. In The Life You Can Save, the Australian philosopher argued that most of us have more than we need to live a comfortable life. The money spent on that excess could instead be used to save someone’s life, and should be.
As Australians near the end of the financial year, eyes wander to sales and minds flicker to the subject of tax deductions. June is traditionally a time when many make charitable donations. But how has the way we give – and think about giving – changed, and how can we do it better?

The flaw is the latest example of Google incorrectly parsing information from websites and trying to present a simple answer to keep users from clicking away from the search engine. The company has pledged that it will now fix the advice after a government request to do so.

                    <span>Readers react to video that exposed the former health secretary’s affair with an aide and the government’s response
In May, Boris Johnson told the Commons that the inquiry into how his government dealt with the coronavirus pandemic wouldn’t start before spring 2022. Johnson said: “We must not inadvertently divert or distract the people on whom we depend in the heat of our struggle against this disease” (Report, 12 May).
What a contrast with the announcement that the Department of Health and Social Care is to launch an investigation (Report, 27 June) into who leaked footage showing Matt Hancock in a clinch with his aide Gina Coladangelo. Announcing the investigation, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said that the department would try “to understand how this happened and to ensure this kind of situation can’t happen again”.

Martin Kettle promotes three Ts for public engagement – truth, transparency and trust – in his incisive article on how new ideas challenge institutional rigidities (What’s happened at the BBC and the Met police shows the perils of groupthink, 24 June).
A three-legged stool provides stability and the Christian trinity is core to faith. Let me add my favourite threesome gained from long experience as an engineering teacher and researcher in several British universities: creativity, tenacity and generosity (CTG).

More than 1,500 legal actions have already been brought against fossil fuel companies whose emissions over decades have played a major role in building up carbon in the atmosphere.

Demonstrations against the Palestinian Authority (PA) have continued across the West Bank after the death in custody of one of President Mahmoud Abbas’s biggest critics.
Several hundred people took to the streets of Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem for the fifth consecutive day on Monday to protest against the treatment of Nizar Banat, a social and political activist, who died during an arrest by the authority’s forces in Hebron on 24 June.

The defending champion, Tadej Pogacar, the 2018 winner, Geraint Thomas, the 2020 runner-up, Primoz Roglic, the Australian star Jack Haig and the sprinters Caleb Ewan, Peter Sagan and Arnaud Démare were among the many high-profile casualties on a day when the peloton tackled narrow winding roads on the fast approach to the finish.

Eye-popping wallpaper trails across sculpture and space like Boyce’s touch in a layered exhibition whose warm embrace of other artists doesn’t always leave enough room for its headliner
Our skin holds us in, is protective but porous, commonplace yet entirely unique. The largest organ, it carries us through the world defining how we feel physically and how we are perceived socially. To exist day-to-day without thinking of it is a privilege afforded to those with the gender, skin colour, health and physique of the accepted hierarchies. Sonia Boyce’s exhibition at Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art is acutely aware of this. Named after the autobiographical novel of colonial revolt by George Lamming, In the Castle of My Skin, the show explores skin through “castle” as an empowering safe place and “castle” as an inescapable prison.
Unsurprisingly, there is a lot of skin in this exhibition – not the peep show kind, but a vibrant film that covers all the plinths and climbs up the walls and on to sculpture. Making use of wallpapers she has been developing since the 1990s, Boyce plasters a kaleidoscopic collage of dancing figures, song lyrics, photographs and natural scenery across the white cube and over jagged sculptures that mimic the shape of fool’s gold and act as a display cabinet for the other, smaller artworks.

I’m Bridget Christie, a comedian, but I don’t just see comedy. Last weekend I went to a spellbinding exhibition of British folk art called Ritual Britain, set perfectly in London’s atmospheric Crypt Gallery in the bowels of St Pancras New Church in London.
Exploring and celebrating Britain’s calendar customs, it’s a collaboration between the artist Ben Edge and Simon Costin from the Museum of British Folklore. It features 20 striking and evocative oil on canvas paintings from Ben’s Frontline Folklore series, alongside objects from Simon’s collection. These included dolls of Morris dancers, a burnt hessian glove from the Ottery St Mary tar barrel burning festival, a selection of folklore archivist Doc Rowe’s photographs and a tall, attractive, well-dressed man made of straw – who has apparently been lined up as Andrew Neil’s next guest on GB news as soon as the exhibition ends on 4 July. Also included in the exhibition is Edge’s illuminating and thought-provoking film Frontline Folklore, documenting the same 20 customs.

When Anne Robinson was announced as the newest Countdown host, it felt a little as if Channel 4 had hired Lewis Hamilton to sit at the wheel of a self-driving car. Robinson is, to paraphrase Liam Neeson, a woman with a particular set of skills; which is to say very sharp-witted and not altogether pleasant.
Countdown, meanwhile, is a peculiarly airless format that has a habit of sucking its presenters dry. The job of a Countdown host is to sit in front of a studio audience who sound so anaesthetised it’s easy to imagine them being cattle-prodded whenever it’s time to applaud, and mumble one-liners that never get more scintillating than “Numbers next”, or “Can you top that, Susie?”

Mercedes principal Toto Wolff says 2022 car is priority

Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team will not cede to their driver’s demands for swift action after the world champion was soundly defeated by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen at the Styrian Grand Prix. Hamilton warned that unless his team delivered upgrades to his car more defeats would inevitably follow, ending his hopes of securing an eighth world championship this season.
The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff insisted, however, that the team will stick to their strategy of not putting resources into this year’s car but was optimistic the fight was far from over. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner said he felt that now was the time to “turn the screw” on Mercedes.

In all the political shocks of the past five years, large claims have been made about their architects: they’re playing multidimensional chess; they have seen straight through Westminster groupthink, into the very heart of the electorate; they have insights into digital campaigning that leave the other team in the dust.
In fact, the calculations that brought us Brexit, Boris Johnson’s victory, a pandemic marked by chaos and cronyism, and all the polling in between, have been repetitive and very simple. There is no limit to the passionate gullibility of a voter whose reptile brain has been activated. So long as your agenda plays to suspicion and hostility, focuses on the external threat of rapacious out-groups, emphasises the scarcity of all resources, which makes fighting for your own interests a necessity, you have your head of steam.

Morning walks are not what they used to be. For years, my whippet, Oscar, and I would take a brisk hour’s trot at eight, taking care of business, physical (him) and mental (me). His bladder and bowels got a workout; the rhythm of our steps and the changing-unchanging view provided a gulp of oxygen and thinking time for my groggy brain.
Now, Oscar arrives outside my bedroom door at about 5.45am, making a polite but insistent noise like a slowly deflating balloon. When I get up, he shadows me, still making this noise, his eyes pools of anxiety, until I give up and grab his lead. Despite every appearance of tearing impatience to get out, the minute we leave the house he grinds to a halt by the front step and licks it insistently. If I don’t move him on, he will spend five minutes doing this, before peeing slowly on the spot, eyes fixed on me in a way that would be deeply creepy if I didn’t know him so well.

Credit to Matt Hancock where it’s due. Overtaking Andrew Lansley to become the 21st century’s worst UK health secretary was no mean feat, but he managed it. Hancock’s record and ignominious exit from an ignominious tenure put him in pole position in the Academy of Useless Ministers.
Everyone has private lives, but Hancock’s affair with Gina Coladangelo became a public interest issue because he appointed her to the health department’s board, on a reported £15,000 salary for a few days’ work a year. This breaches pretty much all of the Nolan standards of public life, and drives a horse and cart through the ministerial code.

                    <span>Analysis: record low turnout makes it difficult to draw clear lessons but both Macron and Le Pen did badly
France’s regional elections produced a humiliating defeat for Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National (RN), stinging failure for Emmanuel Macron and thumping wins for incumbents from the country’s traditional centre-right and centre-left parties.
A record low turnout of less than 35% makes it hard, however, to draw clear lessons for next year’s presidential elections, in which Macron and Le Pen remain clear frontrunners – although the race has certainly got a lot more interesting.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Australia is grappling with several outbreaks of the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus, with a wave of restrictions rolling across the country and plunging some cities into lockdown for the first time since the pandemic began.
Residents of every state and territory in the country – except the island state of Tasmania – are again living under restrictions ranging from full-blown lockdowns in Sydney, Darwin and Perth, to mask mandates in some indoor settings in Adelaide and Canberra.

Olivia Rodrigo has been accused by Courtney Love and others of plagiarism in her artwork and a music video.
Love highlighted similarities between the album cover to Live Through This by her band Hole, photographed by Ellen von Unwerth, and the image used to promote Sour Prom, an Olivia Rodrigo concert film airing on 29 June. Each image features a prom queen in a tiara holding flowers, wearing smeared mascara. Love posted the Sour Prom artwork to Instagram with the caption “Spot the Difference! #twinning”, and later wrote on Facebook: “Stealing an original idea and not asking permission is rude. There’s no way to be elegant about it. I’m not angry. It happens all the time to me. But this was bad form.”

Before we begin, a quick clarification for our non-British readers. Your cider is not our cider. Your cider is merely jumped-up apple juice; ours is furiously alcoholic: lovely, delicious booze that’s just as good served over ice in the summer as it is heated and spiced in the winter. But let’s say you want to cook with cider – what are your options there? I’m glad you asked.

                    <span>Nigella’s cake, gâteau au yaourt, Italian or Ukrainian yoghurt cake, seven-pot cake … so many names, and all of them delicious
I am at the supermarket, standing in front of the milk, cream and yoghurt fridge. To my left, an elderly man lifts his glasses so he can read the small print on the side of a tub of Greek yoghurt. He asks me if it is magro (low-fat), and I tell him it is. To my right, a woman a bit older than me is checking the dates on the milk, reaching deeper and deeper between the bottles, which are swaying like skittles, until she comes to one she is happy with. Only she doesn’t leave; instead, she gestures to the space she has created, an invitation for me to take a bottle with a long date, too. I don’t need milk, but I am always keen to join in, so take a litre anyway, as well as a twin pack of yoghurt. “Magro?” asks the man, still holding his pot. No, I tell him; the one I am holding is intero (whole).
As if there isn’t enough going on in front of the fridge, a man in a spotty face mask and wearing technical leggings crashes his trolley into the metal base of the fridge. It isn’t intentional, just careless. It makes all of us jump, especially the yoghurt man, who drops his pot, which hits the floor hard, splitting the foil and sending a fat blob of yoghurt streaking across the floor like one of those capsules from a paint gun.

At the start of 2018 Bobbie was recovering from a break-up. Seeking a fresh start, she left her job in Essex and travelled to China. “I’d always wanted to go there,” she says. “I wasn’t in a good place when I arrived. I was living on vodka and M&amp;Ms and didn’t have a clear plan.” She found somewhere to stay in Zhongshan, 50 miles from Guangzhou.
In February, she connected with Abelina on a dating app. “I’m from Germany but I was working in Guangzhou for a government organisation. She sent me a message first but I was the one to ask her out,” says Abelina. “I was attracted to her eyes and the beard she had at the time.” Although Bobbie has always known she was a woman, she was presenting as a cisgender man.

It’s early morning and the air vibrates with the sound of birds and frogs at the L’Affût wine estate in Sologne, north-central France. Draught horses Urbanie and Bambi are slowly working their way between rows of vines. Carefully guided by their owner, Jean-Pierre Dupont, and his son, they each pull a cultivator that drags up grass growing between the grapevines.
Several times a year, Urbanie and Bambi can be seen working at L’Affût, often to the surprise of passersby: working horses can be deemed obsolete, relics of a time before the mid-20th century’s mechanisation of farming.

My family had just moved to Kenya, where English was the official language. I was seven and could not speak a word of it, having grown up until that point in an Arabic-speaking country, and been educated at an Arabic school.

The UK has been accused of allowing a fleet of mainly EU “fly-shooting” fishing boats “unfettered access” to the Channel, without a proper assessment of the impact on fish populations, the seabed or the livelihoods of small-scale fishers.
Organisations representing small-scale fishers on both sides of the Channel have warned that the fleet is having a “devastating” effect on their catches. They are calling for a review of the vessels’ UK licences until an impact assessment has been carried out.

They describe the frustration of trying to get through to a Home Office helpline that is often unable to accept calls because of excessive numbers of people seeking advice; many are worried that they may find themselves in a legal limbo, despite government reassurances to the contrary.

In 2017, Harriet Gibsone was a music journalist for the Guardian – working hard, going out lots, and just married. She was ready for her 30s, but not quite ready for a family.
Then, at 31, she started to experience symptoms she couldn’t make sense of: forgetfulness, mysterious mood swings and bouts of weeping, and being woken in the night by sudden hot flushes. The sudden bursts of aggression made her feel like Piers Morgan. Her world was crumbling – but nobody could tell her exactly what was wrong.

                    <span>Photographer Jake Michaels captures the tension between tradition and technology in the Christian community
In 2018, the Los Angeles-based photographer Jake Michaels escaped from Instagram and 24-hour news for a while, to go in search of a community with a different sense of time. A colleague had suggested that he visit the Mennonite settlements in Belize, which were established in the middle of the last century and have hardly changed since. Michaels arrived among homesteads set in lush green hills in the twilight and the village pastor gave him permission to photograph the community’s families. He was struck by the silence, only interrupted by the sound of horses’ hooves and the wooden wheels of the buggies they pulled. He stayed for a long week.
The result of that trip is a book titled c1950 that captures the ways in which the Mennonites, an Anabaptist Christian sect, believe that they should be “in the world but not of it”. Their lives are based on principles of agrarian cooperation and mutual aid: older children take care of younger ones; neighbours are always on hand to fix farm equipment or help out with a harvest. The Belize government allows the group to live mostly independently on their own land; young men are not called up for national service and children are educated in line with the community faith.

                    <span>Now more than ever, novelists are facing up to the unthinkable: the climate crisis. Claire Armitstead talks to Margaret Atwood, Amitav Ghosh and more about the new cli-fi
In September 2017, David Simon, creator of The Wire, tweeted a photograph of golfers calmly lining up their putts on an Oregon course as wildfires raged in the background. “In the pantheon of visual metaphors for America today, this is the money shot,” he wrote of the picture, which was taken by an amateur photographer who spotted the photo-op as she was about to skydive out of a plane. Everything about this story – the image, the circumstances – seems stranger than fiction.
A year before Simon’s tweet, in a landmark polemic, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh had questioned why so few writers – himself included – were tackling the world’s most pressing issue in their fiction. But now, as extreme weather swirls around the globe, melting glaciers, burning forests, flooding districts and annihilating species, the climate emergency has brought the unimaginable into our daily lives and literature. A survivor in Jessie Greengrass’s haunting new novel The High House sums it up: “The whole complicated system of modernity which had held us up, away from the earth, was crumbling … and we were becoming again what we had used to be: cold, and frightened of the weather, and frightened of the dark. Somehow while we had all been busy, while we had been doing those small things which added up to living, the future had slipped into the present.”

                    <span>On the first day of Pride month, the governor of Florida signed a law banning transgender girls from joining girls’ sports teams in schools and colleges. It was just one of 13 anti-trans bills conservative lawmakers in the US passed this year – and one of more than 110 proposed bills, many of which also target access to gender-affirming healthcare. This is by far the largest number filed in a single year in US history.
Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

                    <span>From a leadership fiasco to the ‘sausage wars’, the Democratic Unionist party’s stance on Brexit has forced it to contend with a new – perhaps even existential – set of problems. What will they mean for the region’s future?
When the Democratic Unionist party decided to support Brexit, many warned that the decision could have profound consequences for Northern Ireland’s position within the UK. Five years on, new customs arrangements and an Irish Sea border mean trade flows with the Republic of Ireland are growing – even as imports from Great Britain are slowing. And some on the unionist side fear that bit by bit, the argument for a united Ireland is gaining ground.
Now the region has found itself in the grip of a so-called ‘sausage war’ over chilled processed meats. At the same time, the DUP is about to install its third leader in a month, a crisis at the top that has exacerbated fears that the party could face electoral annihilation. Anushka Asthana speaks to the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, and the Brexit correspondent, Lisa O’Carroll, about a seismic moment for Northern Ireland – and what a political crisis for Stormont’s leading unionist party could mean for the region’s future.

                    <span>Britney Spears has spoken out publicly for the first time against the controversial legal arrangement that has stripped her of independence for 13 years – and handed control of her estate, career and aspects of her personal life to her father, Jamie Spears, who also at times had authority over her medical and mental health treatment. 

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.

On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon due to the combination of social media and McCurry’s picture. Harambe’s image was everywhere. But, despite his photo being shared billions of times, McCurry did not see much of a financial benefit. Now advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.
The Guardian’s technology editor, Alex Hern, tells Rachel Humphreys that this year’s craze for NFTs follows in the wake of speculation on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Now similar technology means unique images, film clips, animations and even poems are being bought and sold online for increasingly large sums.
