That’s it from me tonight. Here’s what we covered:

 12.48am BST 
It was an afternoon of much anticipation and excitement — followed by the saddest trombone sound echoing across the Internet. 
The long-awaited report from US intelligence officials on unidentified flying objects dropped this afternoon, marking one of the first times the US government officially weighed in on strange sightings in the sky. Their big reveal, however, was seen by many as more of a shrug.

My first reaction was knee-jerk. It came from my frustration with how government ultimately works. The thing is, they do absolutely know a lot more than they are letting on. There is just zero way they don’t.
So it still feels a bit like a dance, but I suppose a necessary one.

A suspected tornado has damaged homes, torn down garden walls and sent dustbins flying hundreds of metres through the air in east London.
Footage posted on social media showed havoc caused by strong winds, which left tiles strewn around roads in and around Hulse Avenue, about half a mile from Barking tube station.

‘I tried to push and push and I ran my lungs out. That’s all I had’

On a cold night in Manchester, Father Time delivered a chilling and brutal verdict on the end of Mo Farah’s career as an elite athlete.
Farah had clung on to his dream of defending his Olympic 10,000m title in Tokyo, even as his 40th birthday loomed and the niggles began to pester and hinder more than ever before. But in a specially concocted race put on by UK Athletics on the first day of the British Championships – designed to give him every chance of making the Tokyo Games – the stopwatch delivered a blunt truth. He had finished 19 seconds outside the qualifying mark of 27min 28sec, running a time of 27min 47sec.

Under-strength side goes down to defeat in Warrington

Shaun Wane wanted a test for his first match as England head coach and he certainly got it here. There had been some talk in the run-up to this mid-season international about the calibre of opposition the Combined Nations All Stars would provide in England’s one and only warm-up game before this year’s World Cup.
Whether the tournament actually takes place will be decided next week, with officials locked in discussions over the availability of Australia’s and New Zealand’s players. Without them there will be no World Cup but, if there is, England will almost certainly look back on this night as a vital step in their preparation.

                    <span>The England captain has yet to fire at Euro 2020 but it would be foolhardy to write him off before the knockout stages
Harry Kane is a one‑season wonder. The only thing is it has been every season since 2014‑15. There are times, such as now, as the England captain finds himself under an unforgiving spotlight, when nobody seems to remember the lessons of history, how it is foolhardy in the extreme to write him off. They do not even remember the lessons of the previous month, when the Tottenham striker was collecting his third Premier League Golden Boot award.
To Kane, it does not matter. The noise means nothing. Just as missing a chance does not affect him or enduring a fallow period, as he is at Euro 2020 – it is no goals in England’s three ties so far and only one shot on target. Because one of Kane’s best qualities is that, unlike many centre-forwards, he is not a confidence player.

Asked the inevitable question of whether he feels this may be his last Championships, Murray made himself clear: “I don’t want it to be my last Wimbledon,” he said. “That’s not my plan. I’m not going into Wimbledon thinking I’m saying goodbye. I want to keep going and I want to keep playing, but obviously I don’t know.

The mystery of UFOs seen in American skies is likely to continue following the release of the US government’s highly anticipated UFO report.
The report released on Friday afternoon made clear that while American intelligence officials do not believe aliens are behind the UFOs – or what scientists prefer to call unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) – that were observed by navy pilots, they cannot explain what the flying objects are.

It came out of the sky: US releases highly anticipated UFO report

Anticipation of the unclassified report by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force has, unsurprisingly, sent America’s long-running UFO fascination into overdrive.
The confirmation of an unexplained somethings by even former President Barack Obama has felt unsettling, like a misread headline. The US government … is taking unidentified flying objects … seriously? To have them explicitly, publicly concerned with UFOs seems dubious – like the stuff of movies, which has long been the appropriate and accessible lane for interest in eerie objects in the sky.

Justin Trudeau has said that Canadians are “horrified and ashamed” by their government’s longtime policy of forcing Indigenous children to attend boarding schools where nearly 1,000 unmarked graves have now been discovered – but stopped short of launching a national investigation.
An estimated 751 unmarked graves were recently discovered on the grounds of the former Marieval Indian residential school in Saskatchewan which operated from 1899 to 1997. Last month, 215 remains were reported at a similar school in British Columbia.

Denzel Dumfries’s scintillating displays for the Netherlands at Euro 2020 make him a flag bearer for the potency of self-agency. His is an attitude that says anything and everything can be conquered if the desire is truly there.

Boris Johnson believed the national test-and-trace system was “like whistling in the dark” and that the UK was on course to achieve the “double distinction of being the European country with the most fatalities and the biggest economic hit”, he reportedly told Dominic Cummings at the height of the pandemic’s first wave.
The prime minister allegedly expressed his view in an email to his closest adviser in April 2020 amid concern in Downing Street over serious shortcomings in plans for mass testing by Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care.

The 2021 Tour de France leaves the quayside in Brest at lunchtime on Saturday, a race in transition, changed by the Covid-19 pandemic and changed by the expectations of a world increasingly seeking to foster greater diversity and renewable lifestyles.
In essence the Tour, first run in 1903, is an anachronism – yet the French tradition of picnicking at the roadside, applauding the weary peloton, remains intact, as does the appeal of such a gladiatorial race set against dramatic landscapes. For all the marginal gains, the sports science and the increased influence of technology, the brutal culture of sacrifice and suffering remains intact. In other areas, however, change is afoot.

Matt Hancock is coming under relentless pressure to quit as MPs warned that the health secretary’s rule-breaking tryst with a colleague risked becoming as toxic to voters as Dominic Cummings’ drive to Durham.
Hancock apologised for breaching social distancing guidelines after the Sun newspaper obtained footage from 6 May of him in a clinch with Gina Coladangelo, a non-executive director at the Department of Health and Social Care.

“There’s no added pressure,” he said. “It’s another game of football for us – we’re fully prepared going into it. And we’ve got a gameplan that we think will go and hurt them. It’s not responsibility, it’s an absolute honour to be sat here representing Wales like this and the players feel exactly the same.

A new five-year common agricultural policy (CAP) was provisionally agreed by the European parliament, European Commission and the 27 member states on Friday after two and a half years of negotiations.

But a promotional photo of the range, which features celebrities such as the beauty influencer Kristen Noel Crawley, the actor Quincy Brown and the plus-size model Tabria Majors modelling the neon-orange range of bikinis, swim shorts and bathing suits, prompted commenters to ask why there is no size inclusivity for both sexes.
“I love the range for women, but what about the men?” wrote one person under the post, which features on the Women’s Wear Daily Instagram. “Where are the plus-size male models at? It’s about time too.”

                    <span>Failure to dismiss the health secretary risks making a laughing stock of the government’s Covid strategy
As early as next week, Boris Johnson must decide if England is making sufficient progress in suppressing the Covid pandemic through the vaccine programme to justify ending lockdown restrictions in July. He is increasingly likely to have to tell the country news that it will not want to hear. Friday’s announcement that cases of the Delta variant in the UK increased by 46% over the previous week to a total of 111,157 is daunting. The figures are a severe worsening, not the improvement for which Mr Johnson hoped.
The prime minister must level with the public about the implications for the summer and autumn. Those implications are not good. This is the sort of thing Mr Johnson finds difficult. But things have now been made a great deal harder for him by the admission of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Friday – in what will surely go down as one of the great euphemisms of the era – that he has breached social distancing regulations in his relationship with his departmental aide Gina Coladangelo.

                    <span>Selectively muting phone messages will help draw necessary boundaries between work and home 
“A man perfects himself by working,” wrote Thomas Carlyle in 1843, and though we might rightly have jettisoned other views he held (history as a parade of great men, for instance), we have not only taken this to heart, but expanded work’s dominion. “Work,” wrote Joanna Biggs in All Day Long: A Portrait of Britain at Work, is too often “how we give our lives meaning when religion, party politics and community fall away”.
At the same time, we are increasingly aware that work cannot be everything. The phrase “work-life balance” is problematic, not least because it assumes life only happens when work stops, but its ubiquity nevertheless draws attention to its frequent absence. The pandemic has exacerbated the trend: if you didn’t lose your job, you were quite likely to be working all hours instead. Goldman Sachs juniors rebelling against 18-hour shifts, and MPs warning this month that burnout in the NHS has reached dangerous levels, are only the most obvious outbreaks of a lurking malaise.

Robert Buckland, the UK justice secretary, is to ask the Parole Board to reconsider its decision to approve the release of the child killer and rapist Colin Pitchfork.
The double murderer was jailed in 1988 after raping and strangling 15-year-olds Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth in Leicestershire in 1983 and 1986.

Two big UK tobacco companies have failed to persuade the high court to strike out a case against them that alleges they are responsible for the exploitation of Malawian farming families and child labour in their drive for profits.
British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco deny the allegations. They argued that the Malawian families could not prove that the tobacco they grew had ended up in their cigarettes.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Friday received the first dose of a domestically produced coronavirus vaccine, as many other elderly Iranians queued at 5am in the hope of receiving any jab.
Khamenei, wearing a surgical mask and a black turban and sitting under a picture of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, received a dose of a domestically produced vaccine licensed on 14 June. He was given a single dose of the COVIran Barekat jab, developed by the state-owned foundation Setad. Khamenei said he had been determined to wait for a homegrown vaccine.

Alice Dearing, the first black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics, said on Friday that years of cultural and institutional racism had held up the progress of ethnic minorities in the sport.
The Loughborough University graduate, who has been selected for the 10km open water race in Tokyo next month, added that although she had generally enjoyed a very positive experience in the sport, she had personally been the subject of racism.

Bursts of kaleidoscopic synth-pop, soul balladry and jazz sweep you through the latest offering in the artist’s eclectic, controversial and – against the odds – enduring career
Earlier this week, Billie Eilish was obliged to issue an apology, after an eight-year-old video of the singer emerged, featuring her mouthing along to a racial slur in Tyler, the Creator’s Fish, in a lyric that is also about date rape. It had provoked the kind of bad-faith performative outrage in which certain corners of the internet specialise, but, if nothing else, it functioned as a reminder of different era, in which the Odd Future collective were held to be The World’s Most Notorious Rap Group – a broiling mass of wilful controversy thanks to their lyrics – and Tyler, their de facto leader, was quaintly thought such a threat to public morals that the then-home secretary, Theresa May, successfully petitioned to have him barred from entering the UK.
For all the column inches expended on them, you would have been forgiven for thinking that this was not a career built to last: the succès de scandale tends to burn bright, but not long; dissenting voices wondered if it were possible to translate infamy and a willingness to give their music away for free online into a career. Occasionally, those voices belonged to Odd Future themselves. “I could fail tomorrow. A year from now no one will give a fuck about this interview,” Tyler told the Guardian in 2012. “That’s always in the back of my head. But I have to keep doing what I’m doing.”

Rules limit British athletes’ time spent in European Union

The 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, the former world road race champion Lizzie Deignan and the seven-time Grand Tour winner Chris Froome are among leading names in British cycling to have signed an open letter calling on the government to assist young British riders whose racing careers have been stalled by post-Brexit travel arrangements.
The letter, sent to sport minister Oliver Dowden, argues that rules limiting British citizens, including athletes, to spending 90 days in the European Union in any 180-day period are huge obstacles to career development for young British talent.

Supporters of a white nationalist hate group defaced brand-new memorials to George Floyd in New York and New Jersey this week, even as the nation awaits a sentence for Floyd’s murderer.
Vandals painted the statues’ faces black, and used white markings to reference Patriot Front, a hate group that sprang from a neo-Nazi organization after the deadly “Unite the Right” Charlottesville rally, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Cheryl Rowan, 62, is just the type of voter that the Labour party is desperately trying to hold on to in next week’s byelection in Batley and Spen, and in their former northern heartlands more generally. She lives in one of a small row of council houses in Heckmondwike, a town formerly known for manufacturing blankets as part of West Yorkshire’s heavy woollen district. That industry is long gone.

The government has insufficiently supported the crisis-hit theatre industry because it wants to “discourage ideas and dissent” the leading playwright Laura Wade has warned.
The perception persists, Wade believes, that theatre is a “frivolous” luxury, rather than valued as enriching, and that “people would be doing it whether or not they are being paid”. It had been taken for granted that most towns have a theatre, Wade added. “I think when we lose those, it will be a surprise.”

                    <span>Readers respond to an article by George Monbiot and a recent letter and editorial on housing inequality
George Monbiot is absolutely right (Second homes are a gross injustice, yet the UK government encourages them, 23 June). A housing crisis that has been brewing for decades has been hugely exacerbated in tourist areas by the likes of Airbnb, and further compounded by the ludicrous subsidies, incentives and tax breaks made available to second home owners by successive governments. Owners of two (or more) properties are clearly in a relatively comfortable financial position; there can be no justification – financial or moral – for the grotesque package of government handouts and subsidies outlined by Monbiot.
It has taken years of health warnings and significant tax rises to bring about a significant drop in the number of cigarette smokers. As a first step, rather like the health warnings on a packet of cigarettes, every document/brochure relating to the sale/purchase of a second home should, alongside the usual aspirational guff, be required to carry a prominent strapline quoting Monbiot: “a luxury that deprives other people of a necessity”.

                    <span>Ruth Borthwick on how singing songs from Ladies of the Canyon and Blue sustained her courage on a dangerous trip
Singing songs by Joni Mitchell, whose album Blue turned 50 this week (Joni Mitchell’s Blue: my favourite song – by James Taylor, Carole King, Graham Nash, David Crosby and more, 22 June), kept me going as I trekked through lion country in Uganda in 1981. As a solo traveller, I had been frustrated by my attempts to visit safari parks in Kenya – no pedestrians allowed. But people told me about Chobe, a reserve on the Nile in Uganda; once fashionable with chic Europeans, it was now down on its luck after Idi Amin’s disastrous regime. After hitching through dusty and dangerous country, I reached the derelict gates to find that there was no transport and I would have to walk the five miles through the bush to get to the lodge and a bed for the night.
I summoned up my courage and prayed a that lion wouldn’t consider me tasty as I warbled my way through Ladies of the Canyon and Blue. The horizon eventually filled with the sea that was the Nile, half-submerged hippos glistening in the shallows. This was one river I didn’t wish to skate away on.

Beijing’s crackdown on Xinjiang province, where more than 1 million people are thought to have been detained in a network of internment camps in recent years, has coincided with a rise in efforts to control Uyghurs living overseas, the report found.

As part of the shift to Windows 11, unveiled on Thursday, the company will allow developers to use their own payment systems on apps they sell through the Windows store. Those who do will not have to pay a penny to Microsoft.

On that fabled day in 1966, when England played West Germany at Wembley stadium, there was at least one German who desperately wanted his team to lose. Grim-faced, the Federal Republic’s ambassador to London gathered his staff and told them: “If we win, all our work here will have been in vain.”
He feared that for England to lose a World Cup final at home to the old enemy would reopen a wound that the diplomats had spent 20 years trying to heal. So when the BBC’s Kenneth Wolstenholme uttered the words, “They think it’s all over. It is now!”, the entire embassy went to the nearest pub and “drank itself senseless out of sheer relief”.

Stephen Colbert kicked off Thursday’s Late Show with news that a New York appellate court suspended the law license of infamous Trump acolyte Rudy Giuliani for peddling “demonstrably false and misleading statements to the courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for Donald J Trump”.

More than 1,800 people have backed a call for Spanish officials to regularise the immigration status of an undocumented Senegalese man after his second rescue of a stranger from drowning in the main river in Bilbao.
Mouhammad Diouf was out with a friend on Sunday afternoon when he spotted a man who appeared to be feeling dizzy on one of the city’s bridges. “He was trying to grab on to the rail when he fell into the water,” Diouf told the Guardian. “We were quite far away. I threw down my rucksack and went running.”

Relatives of 38-year-old Bhavna Patel, a British and US citizen, told Sky News that she, Vishal Patel, 42, and one-year-old Aishani Patel are among more than 150 people who authorities in Florida have said are yet to be found.

Four demonstrators who formed a blockade outside a London arms fair have had their convictions quashed by the supreme court, in what has been hailed as an affirmation of the right to protest.
Nora Ziegler, Henrietta Cullinan, Joanna Frew and Chris Cole were charged with highway obstruction after using “lock-on” devices to block an approach road to the ExCeL Centre in Docklands, east London, when it hosted the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair in 2017.

The image of 28-year-old physics student Patsy Stevenson being pinned to the floor by two male police officers, hands held behind her back, on 13 March was one of the defining images in criticism of how the vigil on Clapham Common was policed.

If there’s anything more obnoxious than one Guardianista praising another, I can’t imagine what that would be, so I try to keep secret my almost primal admiration for this newspaper’s Weekend magazine agony aunt. So let’s just say I was listening to a podcast about the teenage brain, and I can’t for the life of me remember who the host was. 
You might think this is only relevant if you’ve got teenagers, but no: it also works if you’ve got toddlers, who are basically the same as teenagers with less lip, and it may also help you if you’re dealing with anyone volatile, impulse-driven, completely at the mercy of their ungovernable moods, which, at various points in and around lockdown, is all of us, right?

As she stood holding her microphone towards the government official, Kwan did not dare look at her phone and the news it heralded: Apple Daily was shutting down. Today.

Ali Smith has won the Orwell prize for political fiction for Summer, a novel written at speed last year, which judges described as “a time-capsule which will prove to be essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the mood of Britain during this turbulent time”.
The Scottish author came up with her project to write four political novels in real time back in 2015, starting with Autumn. Smith began writing Summer, the final book in her Seasonal Quartet, in January 2020 and it was published in August. The novel includes references to Covid-19, Australian wildfires, Brexit and the murder of George Floyd.

                    <span>Vaccination has weakened the link between Covid cases and hospitalisations, but not entirely broken it
This week the steady rise of Covid cases in the UK was accompanied by a worrying signal of rising hospital admissions. Of most concern was the notable increase in the number of people becoming severely ill and requiring mechanical ventilation. It seems clear that the UK has entered a third Covid-19 wave, which raises the question: to what extent will vaccines protect the NHS from unmanageable strain?
The growth of Covid cases across the UK should come as no surprise. The Delta variant is now clearly established and has 20%-60% higher transmissibility than the previous Alpha variant. According to Public Health England, there were 35,204 new cases resulting from the variant last week, and 117 deaths of people confirmed to have the variant and to have had a positive test in the last 28 days. A single dose of the vaccine is also less effective against this new variant. Reported cases continue to be concentrated in younger age groups, many of whom will only now be receiving their first vaccinations. So, while 60% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, 40% remain susceptible – some 21 million people. Coupled with children, this large unvaccinated population is clearly sufficient to drive a third wave of cases. The issue now is whether high vaccine uptake in the UK has broken the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.

I have two children, aged nine and 11. We’ve always limited their tech but just before the pandemic, we bought them tablets to give them access to education, entertainment and their friends. Then I became concerned about their increasing use and placed more limits on screen time.
Full disclosure: I am a phone addict. So I introduced a rule where we all put our devices in a box when we aren’t using them (I break this rule most). During the last lockdown, we got my older child a phone. She had already asked for TikTok – her friends all had it, but I refused because it has all sorts of age-inappropriate stuff. However, that was how her friends communicated, so I allowed it as long as it was a private account on my device, so I could monitor it and her messages. She agreed to this reluctantly. I know I need to step back, but how do I do that without neglecting my duties as a parent?

Coronavirus – latest updates

Covid infection levels have risen steeply in Scotland and experts say the next few weeks will be crucial in monitoring the impact of the Delta variant across the UK.
According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated one in 220 people in Scotland are thought to have had Covid last week – an increase from about one in 600 people in the week ending 12 June.

                    <span>The health secretary once described lockdown-breaking hookups as ‘a matter for the police’. Will he hand himself in?
Sorry, but the only thing I want to see Matt Hancock doing against the back of his office door is sliding down it with his head in his hands. But he can probably bank on not being sacked by Boris Johnson for having an affair. It would be like being sacked by Stalin for being slightly arsey to work with.
Even so, Hancock will be glad that the British Antarctic Territory has been added to the green list, just as he’s been added to the shit list. The South Pole suddenly looks well worth packing his bags for. Temperatures are currently minus 87 but feel like minus 108, making it considerably less frosty than any of Matt’s current climes.

My least favourite memories are the involuntary ones – the ones that flash up in the mind’s eye without warning, like a computer processing error. Even painful memories aren’t so bad if I’ve summoned them, but for them to appear randomly like that? Well, brain, that’s just rude.
It happened last week, walking home. I noticed some neighbours in their front gardens, each having a yard sale.

                    <span>For awkward fat gentlemen like me, warm weather is a mixed blessing
For a while, it looked as if the biggest after-effect of the pandemic’s latest wave would be eternal rain – all day and all night, stopping us from wanting to go outside even though we’re allowed to. Amazon would have seen this coming, and gone big on raincoats, further cementing their dominance, while still not making Jeff Bezos happy. Eventually, it would have reached the point where Bezos had every single bit of money in the world, and we would have to go out into the rain to open our mouths like baby birds, as Bezos-copters flew above us dropping small nutrition balls from the sky. We would have to scrabble and claw at each other for these balls, maybe even sometimes deciding to eat each other instead.
Thankfully, though, the sun came out, and all that looks less likely now. But the hot weather comes as a mixed blessing for awkward fat gentlemen like me. On the one hand, I am delighted that it’s now OK to be eating a Magnum at any time; nobody will judge you. Also, you can happily walk around a children’s farm or a theme park with a beer in your hand when it’s sunny. Do that when it’s cold and rainy, and it feels as if someone is going to come up and stage an intervention.

The country is facing a summer of food shortages likened to a series of “rolling power cuts” because of a loss of 100,000 lorry drivers due to Covid and Brexit, industry chiefs have warned.
In a letter to Boris Johnson they have called for an urgent intervention to allow eastern European drivers back into the country on special visas, similar to those issued to farm pickers, warning that there is a “crisis” in the supply chain.

                    <span>Now that I’ve recognised going to the office as a ritual rather than part of doing my job, dressing up makes sense
I used to think that “going to work” and “doing my job” were the same thing. But since last March, I have been doing my job but not going to work. I work every day, but I never go to the office or to shows. So I guess it turns out that going to work and doing my job are, in fact, two different things.
Back when there were computers in offices but not in homes, you had to go to work to do your job, and so the two activities got all tangled up in our minds. We picture them together, like snow and Christmas Day, as though they are conjoined in the natural order of things. Now that I’ve realised doing my job and going to work are two entirely different activities, I’m worrying about how to do them at the same time (whenever that may be). There are many interesting conversations to eavesdrop on in the office, and getting a snack involves taking a lift and then queueing at a counter to pay, rather than just opening the fridge and eating cheese. This sounds very time-consuming. How did I get anything done?

                    <span>The channel has brought groundbreaking diversity to our screens. It’s doubtful a profits-driven owner would do the same
So, yet again the government is considering the privatisation of Channel 4, and this time it sounds like the threat is serious. What would British public service broadcasting gain and lose if this asset was sold off?
Channel 4 was a brilliant creation of the Thatcher government. It is owned by the state but costs the taxpayer nothing, earning its revenues through advertising and some sponsorship. While it is run commercially, it makes no profit, channelling its revenues back into programmes.
When it came into being, nearly 40 years ago, broadcasters made their own programmes. Channel 4 was different. Even Channel 4 News is not actually made by Channel 4; rather, it is commissioned by the channel. As a result, the new station brought into being a raft of independent television companies that have formed a massively successful industry worth billions a year. All the hit programmes the channel has made are owned by the independent TV companies that make them. These companies sell those brands around the world, bringing significant revenue to the UK but not to Channel 4 itself. In a world of TV titans, Channel 4 is a minnow that does not own the rights to its own shows. So, on the face of it, selling it off to a big company that can invest makes some sense.
But while other broadcasters do now commission significant proportions of their programmes from independent companies, Channel 4 remains the only broadcaster that commissions all its programmes, nurturing many smaller regional companies and ones owned by people from diverse backgrounds. It’s difficult to see why any outfit that bought the channel would want to do the same. The government could lay down all sorts of rules to protect the channel’s output and the independent sector, but over time I fear a major company would pressurise the government to reduce those undertakings.

Even in midsummer, the hills above the market town of Rhayader in mid-Wales should be so soggy that a walk results in unpleasantly damp hiking socks. “It ought to feel really squelchy here,” said the National Trust’s Alan Kearsley-Evans. “Ten or 20 years ago you’d have been ankle deep. Now your feet stay dry.”
Kearsley-Evans is general manager for a sprawling patch that includes the well known peaks of the Brecon Beacons and beaches of the Gower peninsula, but it is his work trying to help restore the much less familiar peat uplands of Abergwesyn common that he believes may be the most important.

Israel has decided to reimpose the mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed public spaces owing to a rise in Covid-19 cases just 10 days after the measure was lifted – a blow for a country that has prided itself on one of the world’s most successful vaccine rollouts.
The head of Israel’s pandemic response taskforce, Nachman Ash, told public radio on Friday that mask mandates in most indoor situations would be reinstated from noon, after the country recorded four successive days of more than 100 new cases. Thursday’s count of 227 new cases was the highest daily caseload in more than two months.

                    <span>Young TikTok users are sharing their passion for books with millions – bringing titles they love to life online and reshaping the publishing world, all in under a minute
In August 2020, Kate Wilson, a 16-year-old from Shrewsbury, posted on the social media video platform TikTok a series of quotes from books she had read, “that say I love you, without actually saying I love you”. Set to a melancholy soundtrack, the short video plays out as Wilson, an A-level student, holds up copies of the books with the quotes superimposed over them. “You have been the last dream of my soul,” from A Tale of Two Cities. “Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same,” from Wuthering Heights. “Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own,” from Jane Eyre. It has been viewed more than 1.2m times.
Wilson’s TikTok handle, @kateslibrary, is among the increasingly popular accounts posting on #BookTok, a corner of TikTok devoted to reading, which has clocked up 9.6bn views and counting, and has been described as the last wholesome place on the internet. Here, users – predominantly young women – post short videos inspired by the books they love. Those that do best are fun, snappy takes on literature and the experience of reading. “Books where the main character was sent to kill someone but they end up falling in love,” from @kateslibrary. “Things that bookworms do,” from @abbysbooks. “When you were 12 and your parents caught you crying over a book,” from @emilymiahreads.

Take housing: job losses and financial hardship have conspired to leave millions of renters in the developed world in arrears. Many have been spared evictions only by government moratoriums on landlords turfing tenants out.

                    <span>For many of life’s major celebrations and ceremonies, Covid restrictions were relaxed on 21 June in England. From the first dance to saying goodbye to loved ones, what do the new rules mean for you?
There’s no denying that weddings are joyful, but they also come freighted with a list of unwritten rules, which guests should obey but often breach.
Of course, during the pandemic, weddings and other significant life events, from civil partnerships to funerals, baptisms, barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs, have been governed by another, tougher but necessary, set of guidelines: downsized guest numbers, hand sanitisation after exchanging rings, fathers walking their daughters down the aisle 1 metre apart.

The UK transport secretary has refused to say he would book a foreign holiday for himself and his family yet, even as travel restrictions are eased for several destinations.
Grant Shapps warned anyone looking to travel abroad that the rules could change at short notice after Malta, Madeira and the Balearic islands, among others, were added to the list of countries from which travellers could return without having to quarantine.

Yellowstone, established in 1872, is famous around the globe for good reason: it’s the oldest national park in the United States and one of the most popular.
But a new report issued this week shows how Yellowstone’s near pristine environment, with attractions like the Old Faithful geyser and herds of bison, is under threat from global heating.

At the moment, people who travel to amber list countries have to quarantine on return, however on Tuesday the health secretary said ministers are planning to allow quarantine-free travel to amber-list countries for people in England who have been fully vaccinated.

                    <span>On the first day of Pride month, the governor of Florida signed a law banning transgender girls from joining girls’ sports teams in schools and colleges. It was just one of 13 anti-trans bills conservative lawmakers in the US passed this year – and one of more than 110 proposed bills, many of which also target access to gender-affirming healthcare. This is by far the largest number filed in a single year in US history.
Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

                    <span>From a leadership fiasco to the ‘sausage wars’, the Democratic Unionist party’s stance on Brexit has forced it to contend with a new – perhaps even existential – set of problems. What will they mean for the region’s future?
When the Democratic Unionist party decided to support Brexit, many warned that the decision could have profound consequences for Northern Ireland’s position within the UK. Five years on, new customs arrangements and an Irish Sea border mean trade flows with the Republic of Ireland are growing – even as imports from Great Britain are slowing. And some on the unionist side fear that bit by bit, the argument for a united Ireland is gaining ground.
Now the region has found itself in the grip of a so-called ‘sausage war’ over chilled processed meats. At the same time, the DUP is about to install its third leader in a month, a crisis at the top that has exacerbated fears that the party could face electoral annihilation. Anushka Asthana speaks to the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, and the Brexit correspondent, Lisa O’Carroll, about a seismic moment for Northern Ireland – and what a political crisis for Stormont’s leading unionist party could mean for the region’s future.

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.

On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon due to the combination of social media and McCurry’s picture. Harambe’s image was everywhere. But, despite his photo being shared billions of times, McCurry did not see much of a financial benefit. Now advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.
The Guardian’s technology editor, Alex Hern, tells Rachel Humphreys that this year’s craze for NFTs follows in the wake of speculation on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Now similar technology means unique images, film clips, animations and even poems are being bought and sold online for increasingly large sums.

Boris Johnson’s government has set “historic” targets on the climate crisis but has failed so far to come up with the policies needed to reach them, the government’s independent advisers on the climate have warned.
The Climate Change Committee published two progress reports on Thursday, showing the UK lagging behind on its key goal of 78% cuts to greenhouse gases by 2035 and making recommendations on how to get back on track.

On 10 March 1987, a 37-year-old private investigator named Daniel Morgan was found dead in a south London pub car park with an axe embedded in his head. Despite the arrests of several men, the initial investigation did not lead to any charges and the murder has gone unsolved amid allegations of police corruption. 
The Metropolitan police have previously accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers. But a new panel inquiry concluded last week that the crime was probably “solvable” had it not been undermined. The force was described as “institutionally corrupt” and its commissioner, Cressida Dick, personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry.

                    <span>We would like to hear if you have changed your mind about your wedding attire during the pandemic 
For couples who decided to get married during the last 18 months, wedding plans have often had to be altered. Pandemic restrictions sparked a rise in pared-back micro-weddings and virtual ceremonies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has also has an impact on the day’s dress code, with many brides (in particular) opting for a more relaxed look over a formal wedding dress.
With this in mind, we’d love to hear from those who re-thought their wedding attire during the pandemic. Perhaps you decided to go for a cocktail dress, rather than a floor-skimming evening gown? Or maybe you decided not to wear a dress at all? Tell us about it, and share your photos, here.

                    <span>Omar Abu al-Ouf lost his parents, grandparents and two siblings when his building was bombed by the Israeli military last month, in a street where 43 people were killed. Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>It may still sound like the stuff of science fiction, but some of the biggest companies in the world are investing hugely in previously fanciful transport technologies

From 2030, new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned in Britain – a sure sign that we’re on the threshold of a transport revolution. But what exactly will this revolution look like? With estimates that the market for autonomous vehicles could be worth almost £42bn in just over a decade, the future of transport looks to be anything but boring. Here are five things you need to know …
Driverless cars take to the roads
While fully autonomous vehicles (where the driver could, in theory, watch a film while the vehicle takes the controls) are still a way off, the first driverless cars – with automated lane-keeping systems that allow drivers to safely take their hands off the wheel – could be on Britain’s roads this year. In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix. The road to the driverless future may still be a little bumpy, but it is showing signs of smoothing out.
