The US justice department is halting all federal executions after a historic use of capital punishment by the Trump administration, which carried out 13 executions in six months.
The attorney general, Merrick Garland, ordered a temporary pause on Thursday, saying he was imposing a moratorium on federal executions while the justice department reviews its capital punishment policies and procedures.

Hundreds of firefighters are battling in high heat against several wildfires in the forests of far northern California, where the flames have already forced many communities to evacuate.
Mount Shasta, the volcano that towers over the region, was shrouded on Thursday in a haze of smoke plumes so huge they could easily be seen in images from weather satellites in space.

Eilish McColgan takes Radcliffe’s British record in 5,000m

Karsten Warholm has finally taken down one of the oldest world records in athletics by beating Kevin Young’s 29-year-old 400m hurdles best in front of his home crowd in Oslo.
After powering home in 46.70sec to break the previous record by 0.07, the 25-year-old Norwegian described it as the “perfect moment” – but admitted he may have to go even quicker to win gold at the Olympics in Tokyo. Incredibly it was the 12th track and field world record set this year in the new era of super spikes. What made Warholm’s achievement particularly impressive was that he broke it running in his first race of the outdoor season.

The president and first lady Jill Biden also met with teams of first responders and rescue workers who have been searching painstakingly but fruitlessly for survivors in the rubble of Surfside’s Champlain Towers South for more than a week.

It is 4.30pm at St George’s Park, the England midfielder is late for his media interview – actually he is really late – and, deadlines being deadlines, his audience is shifting uncomfortably. “Yeah, every day, I have my afternoon nap … I ain’t the same man without it,” Grealish says, with a wink.

We don’t know precisely how much public money has been promised but, if the rumoured £100m is correct, the figure doesn’t sound widely different from what other European governments are throwing around to secure high-profile electric vehicle investments. Everyone’s at it.

                    <span>Pratt plays a teacher turned pre-emptive conscript for a future war with aliens in this overlong and derivative actioner
We’ve come an awfully long way since Chris Pratt was the goofy comic turn Andy Dwyer in TV’s Parks and Recreation, pretending to be top-secret FBI agent Burt Macklin. These days he’s got the chops to be a tough, chiselled action lead who removes his shirt to reveal some serious work with the personal trainer, and this is how he’s presented in this great big overstuffed and overlong sci-fi action thriller from former animation director Chris McKay. In Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World, Pratt had at least some residue of his former comedy existence, and to be fair there are one or two funny lines here (coming largely from JK Simmons, playing Pratt’s grumpy yet adorable dad), but this is a very earnest and generic lead performance.
Pratt plays Dan Forester, an idealistic soldier-turned-high school teacher with a wife and young daughter; he lives in an America that is suddenly terrified by visitors from the future who reveal that in 30 years’ time Earth will be attacked by weird, white, lizard-like creatures (not a million miles away from those in the sci-fi horror A Quiet Place). Humanity is so low on soldiers that they have to time-travel into the past to recruit more personnel and bring them into the future to fight this “tomorrow war” against the alien creatures. And Dan is duly drafted into the head-spinningly weird conflict, coming into contact with fellow warriors like cheerfully nerdy Charlie (Sam Richardson), tough and cynical Dorian (Edwin Hodge) and also Norah (Mary Lynn Rajskub). But most importantly there is the charismatic female commanding officer, played by Yvonne Strahovski (from The Handmaid’s Tale). The encounter messes with Dan’s mind: you’ve heard of back to the future, but this is forward to the past, or maybe sideways to the next generation.

                    <span>Watermill theatre, Newbury
With Paul Hart’s production blending into the theatre grounds, the pastoral comedy here becomes an effective vehicle to reflect on our relationship with nature 
It is not often you hear Taylor Swift and the Beach Boys in Shakespeare. But pop music works up the romantic atmosphere in Yolanda Mercy’s adaptation of the pastoral comedy, directed by Paul Hart. Staged in the Watermill’s verdant grounds (weeping willows, ducks, gushing water), the actors sing and play a blend of folksy guitar, ukulele, bass, harp and flute.
Its bigger message is on environmental change and Katie Lias’s set design carries that symbolism: the court, filled with empty oil drums, is part construction site and part derelict greenhouse where characters wear hard-hats and hi-vis vests. The lush forest of Arden blends into the theatre’s grounds so that we are not only told that “all the world’s a stage” but understand that this stage is our own world, too, and needs rewilding. Actors walk among us to blur the boundaries further.

Ministers are planning to remove all mandatory mask and social distancing restrictions in England on 19 July, but national guidance may still encourage caution in high-risk areas such as public transport.
A number of key scientific advisers including England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, are said to be behind ministers’ plans to lift restrictions, though they have cautioned that the NHS may come under pressure in the winter.

The opening of Slovenia’s presidency of the EU has descended into farce as the European Commission’s vice-president refused to be photographed with the country’s rightwing prime minister, Janez Janša, after a bitter behind-the-scenes row at a launch event.
During an opening meeting in the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, with the 27 members of the commission, Janša had shown them a group photograph of a Slovenian judge with a Socialist and Democrat MEP and other members of the country’s Social Democrats party.

Darren Jones, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, has written to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to ask the watchdog to clarify its powers to intervene “when new owners act irresponsibly”.

This country needs a serious conversation about England. Not about the England football team – that’s for another day. The conversation this country – the United Kingdom – needs is about England’s future political and constitutional relationship with the rest of the union.
A particular version of that conversation simmers perpetually in Northern Ireland. A dynamic one rages in Scotland. A third variation is developing in Wales. In England itself, the conversation lurks between niche and nonexistent. The issue is nevertheless latent. Its manifestations, refracted through issues including Brexit, are pored over by a minority. But the English question has rarely been explicit.

                    <span>The health service and the public face colossal risks. The last thing NHS England needs is a ministerial crony in charge 
It hardly needs saying that the appointment of a new chief executive to run NHS England is an enormously important moment. Sir Simon Stevens has run the service for seven years and his departure coincides with a shake-up. His successor will be a less powerful figure, who stands, in an upcoming health bill, to be stripped of the independence granted as part of the last round of Conservative reforms.
Giving control back to ministers was always a questionable move, particularly given the government’s record during the pandemic. Circumstances surrounding the departure of Matt Hancock have heightened concerns about cronyism. But the prospect of the service’s new boss being chosen by a newcomer, Sajid Javid, does not inspire confidence either (the task is undertaken jointly with NHS England’s board). At a time of great peril for the service and the 56 million people who rely on it (just 11% of the UK population are thought to have private health insurance), the situation is chaotic, with health minister Lord Bethell also facing questions about why he sponsored Gina Coladangelo for a parliamentary pass.

“I had the chance to have some in-depth discussions with him and it became clear that as well as scoring lots of goals, Romelu’s second major quality, and one I could feel immediately, was his positive mindset,” says Jacobs, a former defender who spent five years as Anderlecht’s manager.

                    <span>Two-time Wimbledon champion still feeling his way back from injury and Canadian 10th seed is a serious obstacle
In the 16 years since Andy Murray made his debut at Wimbledon, the Scot has experienced almost every emotion imaginable at the All England Club: from devastation and tears when he was beaten in the final by Roger Federer in 2012, to jubilation the following year when he won the title, more elation when he did so again in 2016 and sheer agony in 2017 when his sore hip finally began to give way.

In 2013, when Jaivet Ealom sat squeezed in a boat with other asylum seekers, he prayed, not for the first time, for an easy death. They were far from shore off the coast of Indonesia, the vessel was sinking, and Ealom could not swim.
Fishermen from a nearby island came to the rescue, hauling each passenger from the half-submerged vessel. Ealom was saved. But during the chaos, a small baby fell into the ocean. “It never resurfaced,” remembers Ealom. “[The mother] just screamed from the bottom of her lungs. It was traumatising.”

AK Blakemore has won the Desmond Elliott prize for best debut, with her historical novel about the English witch trials of the 17th century, The Manningtree Witches, praised by judges as a “stunning achievement”.
Following the story of Rebecca West, who is husbandless, fatherless and barely tolerated by the villagers of Manningtree, Essex, the novel depicts the fallout as pious newcomer Matthew Hopkins begins to ask after the women on the margins of society. It is Blakemore’s first novel, although the author has previously published two collections of poetry.

Amartya Sen has delivered a critical appraisal of British rule in India (Illusions of empire: Amartya Sen on what British rule really did for India, 29 June). Yet what is missing from his ponderings is a clear critique of the apologist arguments which underpin inquiries into the so-called “achievements” of colonialism.
Instead, he highlights an issue of methodology, namely the impossibility of envisaging an India in which British rule had not occurred. While Sen acknowledges the difficulty of such an evaluation, he finds merit in queries which seek to establish how India was lacking at the time of British conquest and how those deficiencies were met by the new rulers. He promptly embarks on such an examination.

                    <span>Salley Vickers, Angelica Goodden, John Doherty, Eddy York and Barbara Benedict weigh in on an eternal linguistic debate
Re David Roberts’ letter deploring your use of a split infinitive (29 June); Fowler, the acknowledged authority on English usage, says: “The split infinitive is … best avoided, especially when it is stylistically awkward. But it is not a major error nor a grammatical blunder; it is acceptable, even necessary, when considerations of rhythm and clarity require it.” What’s good enough for Fowler is good enough for me.
Salley Vickers
London
• The “rule” about not splitting infinitives doesn’t apply to English: it derives from the mistaken notion that the English verb consists in a single word that mustn’t be interrupted in the middle, in common with Latin and the Romance languages derived from it. “To hardly try” is correct English; “to try hardly” is nonsense, and “hardly to try” in most contexts sounds formal. I always encourage students to write expressively, which often entails putting something (normally an adverb) between “to” and whatever verb is being used.

In a 6-3 ruling, the justices upheld Arizona statutes that prohibit anyone other than a close family member or caregiver from collecting mail-in ballots, which are widely used in the state.

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

A rash of cases of a rare “black fungus” infection affecting thousands of critically ill Covid patients in India caused alarm last month. Now scientists are warning that other dangerous or even deadly fungal infections have spawned in critically ill coronavirus patients globally, including in the UK.
Fungi are ubiquitous – in soil, water, air, faeces and human skin. Usually, people’s elaborate, adaptive immune systems are enough of a repellent but when that shield is weakened by disease, congenital conditions or age, they are far more vulnerable to microscopic assailants.

The all-party parliamentary group on democracy and the constitution found the Metropolitan police’s actions and that of Avon and Somerset constabulary (A&amp;SC) at “kill the bill” demonstrations in Bristol breached fundamental rights to protest and involved unnecessary and disproportionate use of force.

Ian Rank-Broadley’s statue of Diana, commissioned by her sons, was kept secret until its unveiling as if it might be wildly provocative. Looking through the artist’s previous oeuvre, I noticed he has a taste for the nude and created a statue for the late Felix Dennis called Lord Rochester, His Whore and a Monkey. That raised the fascinating prospect of a naked Diana for everyone to get furious about.
Instead, he’s let it all hang out in a different way. The sentiment splurges across the flower beds like an uncontrolled wail of artistically absurd pathos. A larger than life Diana, who stands in an awkward, stiff, lifeless pose and has a face that’s more manly than I remember, modelled apparently with thickly gloved hands and no photo to consult, protects two children in her arms while a third lurks behind her.

One of the most enduring chess records, Sergey Karjakin as the youngest grandmaster ever at 12 years seven months, was finally broken on Wednesday afternoon. Abhimanyu Mishra, from Englishtown, New Jersey, US, who was already the youngest ever international master at 10 years nine months, achieved his third and final GM norm at 12 years four months. Mishra achieved the 2500 rating requirement a few weeks ago, and his title will soon be confirmed by Fide. Mishra learned to play chess at two-and-a-half and became the youngest ever US expert at seven.
Karjakin’s record had narrowly survived serious attempts by India’s current generation of talents, but Mishra’s concentrated campaign, launched after the pandemic derailed his competitive play for the best part of a year, reached its target with 66 days to spare. His father’s key move was a one-way air ticket from the US to Budapest, which currently has a continuous series of GM and IM tournaments.

Talks to secure City of London access to the EU have stalled, Rishi Sunak has confirmed in his first Mansion House speech to financiers, as he set out sweeping reforms designed to help Britain’s finance industry embrace global opportunities after Brexit.
Addressing a hand-picked gathering of 40 young financial workers at a slimmed-down version of what was, in the days before the pandemic, a landmark annual gathering, the chancellor said a deal on a comprehensive post-Brexit financial services settlement with the EU had not happened.

Millions of UK motorists will no longer have to obtain an insurance “green card” before taking their car to EU countries after the requirement for extra Brexit-related paperwork was dropped.
The European Commission announced it had waived the obligation when it unveiled several other concessions designed to defuse tension around the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.

                    <span>While Boris Johnson panders to older voters, younger generations’ prospects are bleaker than ever
Here’s a tale of two generations, the pensioners and young workers. As the pandemic furlough winds down this week, one generation is destined for a mighty windfall from the government while the other gets nothing. The reason is clear: the Tories win three times more votes from one group than the other.
As of this week, employers start picking up the furlough bill, previously paid by the government, and many will let staff go, with their businesses still running on empty. Most of those losing jobs will be young people in the low-paid hospitality, arts, entertainment and tourism sectors, who, warns the Resolution Foundation, will struggle to find work: reports of worker shortages “have been overplayed”, and so have reports of steep pay rises. But those artificial pay-rise figures are about to deliver a bonanza for pensioners.

The quarter-finals kick off on Friday afternoon, when the survivors of manic Monday meet in St Petersburg. Switzerland beat world champions France in a dramatic encounter in Romania in the last 16. After taking an early lead and then missing their chance to double it from the penalty spot, Switzerland had to fight back from 3-1 down to take the game to extra time before eventually winning on penalties.

Cavendish is only two wins shy of Eddy Merckx’s record

An irrepressible Mark Cavendish made it a hat-trick of wins in Châteauroux, blasting past his sprint rivals once more to claim his 32nd stage win in the Tour de France. Victory in stage six’s drag-strip finish, which he described as a “massive old-school Tour de France sprint”, demonstrated that the momentum once lost to his career has returned with a vengeance.
With two stage wins in three days, the rider whose form was so cold that he was virtually frozen out of cycling is now piping hot again. This time there were few tears, just jubilation, as he hugged his Deceuninck-Quick-Step teammates beyond the finish line.

The devastating “heat dome” has caused temperatures to rise to almost 50C in Canada and has been linked to hundreds of deaths, melted power lines, buckled roads and wildfires.

Sadeh Farmhouse (sadeh means field in Hebrew), in a 17th-century manor house just inside the M25 near Orpington, opened recently after major refurbishment transformed it from a residential activity centre for city schoolchildren to a rural ecoretreat for families.

When I was 17, during a confessional campfire round-robin on a school trip, a teaching aide made a striking admission. “I don’t know when it suddenly became the thing to hug all of your friends, but I don’t really like hugging,” I remember her saying.
This eminently reasonable personal preference surprised me. In the mid-late aughts of my western Canadian adolescence, social hugging was so ubiquitous that it never occurred to me to question the practice. I hugged people frequently throughout my youth: my family, my schoolmates, the kindly lady who taught me piano.

The news that Gap is to close all 81 of its stores in the UK and Ireland will hardly come as a surprise to those in the fashion industry. Once a favourite of insiders looking for classic minimal pieces without the price tags of catwalk labels, its position has faded in recent years, replaced by brands including Arket, Weekday and Uniqlo.
Founded in 1969 in San Francisco, Gap came to the UK in 1987 and has long been known for American classics such as khakis, jeans and white T-shirts. After various sweatshop allegations in the 90s and early 00s, it positioned itself as the home of premium basics and kept its fashion relevance for a long time by balancing its blue-chip heritage with collaborations with buzzy young designers including Alexander Wang, Rodarte and Band of Outsiders. These names reworked classic designs that would showcase in slick adverts with supermodels including Liya Kebede.

Jair Bolsonaro has been plunged into arguably the most treacherous moment of his presidency, as the Brazilian leader faces a snowballing scandal over allegedly corrupt Covid vaccine deals and mounting public rage over his handling of an epidemic that has killed more than half a million people.
Tens of thousands of protesters are expected to return to the streets on Saturday to demand Bolsonaro’s removal from office – the third such mass demonstration in just over a month. On Wednesday a curious coalition of left- and rightwing opponents submitted a fresh petition for Bolsonaro’s impeachment after the Brazilian media published incendiary claims about supposedly dodgy dealings to acquire coronavirus vaccines.

Lip-syncing in Dennis Potter’s 1993 musical drama Lipstick on Your Collar was all very well. Crooning for real opposite Nicole Kidman, McGregor looks and sounds strained to say the least. But then his entire floundering performance represents a mere fender bump in Baz Luhrmann’s car crash of a musical. “His idea of conveying high emotion is to let his mouth hang wide open,” noted the critic Anthony Quinn.

Suzanne Heywood, whose husband, Jeremy Heywood, was the cabinet secretary when the financier Lex Greensill entered Downing Street, questioned whether Nigel Boardman was the right person to run an inquiry into many conflicts of interest.

                    <span>With the Delta variant surging, questions about how to control infections, especially in children, are as urgent as ever

At the start of the pandemic, the ideal path – for those countries able to control their frontiers – was elimination of the virus within their borders pending the arrival of vaccines and treatments.
The UK didn’t make that choice – and it has paid the price in ways we know all too well. However, we’re now in a different phase, with highly effective and safe vaccines allowing us to work towards population immunity through inoculation rather than natural infection. We also find ourselves in the position of being a Petri dish for the latest variant, Delta, and how vaccines hold up against it. So far the signs are hopeful – but since the protection offered by one dose of the vaccine is much lower, there’s every incentive to get as many people double-jabbed as quickly as possible.

When I was 11 years old, I saw my first live band performance, in our old gym at school. Some kids who were four years older than me had a band and they played cover songs: Weezer, Pearl Jam, Nirvana – lots of grunge music. I remember thinking it was a superpower because they could make people dance. That’s when I knew that was what I wanted to do.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Authorities and health experts in Spain have called for prudence and responsibility amid a surge in cases among young people who are still waiting to be vaccinated after more than 1,000 Covid cases across the country were traced back to an end-of-year school trip to Mallorca.
Although more than a third of Spain’s 47 million people have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, case numbers have been rising over recent days – most notably among younger people still waiting to get their shots.

“Where the Taliban go, they bring destruction, and they are one kilometre away from my village,” he told the Guardian. “We decided to respond.”

“History is on our side,” says Gülsüm Kav. She leans in and speaks intensely. She has a lot to say: Kav helped create Turkey’s We Will Stop Femicide (WWSF) group, and has become one of the country’s leading feminist activists even as the political environment has grown more hostile.
Amid protests, Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul convention, the landmark international treaty to prevent violence against women and promote equality, on Thursday. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has long attacked women’s rights and gender equality, suggesting that feminists “reject the concept of motherhood”, speaking out against abortion and even caesarean sections, and claiming that gender equality is “against nature”.

She has a temporary office and two staff on secondment from Liberal Democrat colleagues, but she also has to recruit employees for her Buckinghamshire constituency, where the party does not have a long-established presence.

                    <span>In Canada, more than 1,000 unmarked graves have been discovered on the grounds of former church-run residential schools, where an estimated 150,000 First Nations children were sent as part of a campaign of forced assimilation for more than a century until 1996. 
A historic truth and reconciliation commission was conducted in the 2000s. In 2015 it concluded that the residential school system amounted to cultural genocide and that unmarked graves would be found in the former school grounds, but the recent findings still shocked many Canadians and prompted calls for a new investigation. Leyland Cecco explains how the discovery is just the tip of the iceberg in uncovering Canada&#x27;s traumatic colonial past

                    <span>Xi Jinping himself has warned China’s wealth gap is not only economic but political and could threaten party’s legitimacy
When Wang Zhenyu moved out of his small village in central Henan province to the coastal city of Dalian at 18, he was astonished. “It was like a culture shock for me, even though it was just a big city in my country, not a foreign land.” A few years later when he was enrolled in Peking University as a graduate student, he found much fewer students in the country’s top university coming from a similar background to his.
Growing up in a small village of 2,000 farmers, many of Wang’s childhood friends dropped out of school after finishing their nine years of compulsory education. Now with a decent academic job, Wang begins to experience “reverse culture shock” every time he goes back to his village for the annual lunar new year.

From announcement to construction to opening, new public amenities provide ministers with multiple opportunities to show voters that their administration is making a difference.

                    <span>Centred on a killer virus, Sweet Tooth could have been the most troubling TV to watch during Covid. Instead, as its creators and star Nonso Anozie attest, the Netflix show has become a smash because it’s so redemptive – and happy

The pandemic might not be over yet, but you can already trace a line through the culture it has produced. The overenthusiastic “let’s put on a show!” mania of cast reunions filmed over Zoom quickly gave way to the gnawing listlessness depicted in Bo Burnham’s comedy special Inside. Another part of the line, however, happened by accident.
Netflix’s Sweet Tooth is a series about a devastating global pandemic that kills millions of people and resets humanity. It was filmed last summer, in that brief golden gulp between Covid lockdowns. However, Sweet Tooth wasn’t rush-produced to reflect the situation; instead, it is based on a decade-old graphic novel and has been in development for five years.

                    <span>Horror film Kindred finds a pregnant young woman battling sinister in-laws –  not a position its star plans to find herself in. She explains why she’s drawn to strong, resilient characters
Tamara Lawrance says she has “very little desire to be pregnant” and, given the subject matter of her latest film, who can blame her? She stars in the dread-filled psychological horror Kindred as Charlotte, a young woman living in an isolated part of rural England, whose life plans go awry when she gets pregnant with her boyfriend (Edward Holcroft) and is taken into the quasi-care of his sinister family, in their crow-infested, crumbling mansion. Fiona Shaw makes for an imperious matriarch, while Jack Lowden is unnervingly obsequious as the black-sheep stepbrother.
“I really enjoyed the fact that [Charlotte] was not maternal,” says Lawrance, describing the allure of the script by writer-director Joe Marcantonio. “It’s an assumption that women are born with this innate, God-given inclination to take care of babies and there’s countless testimonies of that, but there’s also a wealth of other experience and evidence out there.” To be a woman aged anywhere between 25 and 45 is to be bombarded with images of maternal fulfilment, plus a constant stream of questions regarding one’s womb.

I love to walk and be surrounded by nature but my children not so much. One thing we all love is the Wind in the Willows so when we saw there was a trail at Hanningfield reservoir in Essex, I was keen to try and get their little legs moving so we packed a picnic and set off in pursuit of Mr Toad and the gang. We bought a map for £1 which my youngest loved as it made him feel like a pirate! The walk was enjoyed by all as we excitedly spotted our favourite characters brilliantly carved from wood. Later we borrowed binoculars from the visitor centre to spot birds, which was an added bonus and extended the day nicely.

                    <span>However the government sugarcoats the EU settlement scheme, European citizens living in the UK will now be seen as outsiders
“We asked for workers, we got human beings instead,” was how the Swiss author Max Frisch summed up the “guest worker” schemes that helped wealthy European countries rebuild their economies after the second world war. His quip lives on because it expresses the absurdity of societies that treat immigration as purely a question of economic need, reducing people to units that can be moved here and there as capital sees fit.
However partial and flawed it may be, the EU’s system of internal free movement is an attempt to escape that trap. In stripping away the obstacles and restrictions that continue to govern migration for most of the world, it is an acknowledgment that when people move, they develop new attachments to the places they come to call home and to the people they come to call neighbours – and a wager that the best way to grow a shared sense of belonging is to make that process as easy as possible.

People across the country are waking up to the reality that Canada is a country built on the violent dispossession of Indigenous peoples. The horrifying reports of unmarked graves of children at residential “schools” in Kamloops, British Columbia, Brandon, Manitoba, and most recently Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan have shocked many Canadians and others around the world. However, these were not discoveries, but confirmations of what we knew all along: Canada was built on genocide.

                    <span>Experts worry that immunocompromised people and those who unable to access the vaccine have been forgotten
Just as the troubling Delta variant was spreading through the US, Charis Hill got a worrying call from their doctor.
The medications Hill takes to treat their spondylitis affect their immune system, and they knew the Covid-19 vaccine might not work as well for them as it does for others. So weeks after their second shot, they got a test.

What to see at Edinburgh fringe 2021

The producers of the Edinburgh festival fringe are hoping for a “joyous, beautiful experience” after unveiling the schedule for a far smaller season of theatre, dance, comedy and music.
Tickets for this year’s fringe went on sale on Thursday morning with producers favouring outdoor venues such as beaches, city squares, courtyards and pedestrianised streets, as they adapt to Scotland’s stricter Covid lockdown rules.

                    <span>Many people yearn to grow their own food and live a simpler life – but, when coronavirus hit, some decided it was now or never. Have their dreams of burgeoning veg patches and frolicking livestock come true?
On their one-acre plot of Hertfordshire countryside, Sarah Apps and Liam Armstrong live with three chickens, 59 tomato plants and – until this morning – three pigs. “It’s been an emotional day,” says Apps. They plan to get more pigs later in the summer, and next week more chickens are arriving; then ducks and a goat, a couple of turkeys for Christmas and, maybe next year, bees. Living on their own land, and becoming more self-sufficient, had been a bit of a dream for the couple, but it took the Covid pandemic to make it happen. “You just didn’t know what was going to happen,” says Apps. “Young people were dying, older people were dying … I think you really need to live for the days that you’ve got.”
When they spotted a run-down bungalow that came with an acre of land, they went for it. They had been living in Romford, East London. “We could hear the roar of the M25 and I could barely be bothered to mow the small patch of lawn we had,” says Apps. They moved in November and spent the winter creating raised vegetable beds, putting in fencing and making animal enclosures. It has been gruelling physical work – they have done it mostly by hand – moving around 30 tonnes of soil. “It was our fitness thing through lockdown,” says Apps. But now they have growing just about every type of vegetable you’d find in a well-stocked supermarket, eggs every day, and in a few days the pigs will return for the freezer. She breaks off to check on a chicken who is in their kitchen. “She’s just had a bath. She’s not very well.”

President Xi Jinping told a crowd of 70,000 in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square that the era of China being bullied was ‘gone forever’ and the country would not allow ‘sanctimonious preaching’ from foreign forces. Anyone who tried ‘will find themselves on a collision course with a steel wall forged by 1.4 billion people’

Disabled woman begins legal action over Hampstead ponds fees

Micah Sami spent her teenage years swimming in the Hampstead ladies’ pond. The freedom to access the water, or sit in the meadow, helped her cope whenever she wasn’t feeling great.
But since the City of London Corporation (CoLC) enforced charges for the first time in the history of the ponds last year – and raised them again earlier this year, a move now the subject of a legal challenge – it doesn’t feel the same.

                    <span>Apple Daily was a beacon of free speech. Now it has been forced to close by China’s sweeping national security law. Does its demise signal a new chapter in Hong Kong?
Apple Daily is one of Hong Kong’s most popular newspapers, standing for freedom of speech and backing the city’s pro-democracy movement as it attempted to resist Beijing’s draconian national security law and wider attempts to muzzle dissent. Last week, after hundreds of police raided the publication’s headquarters, confiscated journalists’ laptops and arrested senior staff, it published its final edition. Even after many setbacks for activists, the closure of the newspaper has been seen as a significant development – and, some argue, the end of freedom of speech in the city.
Rachel Humphreys spoke to a journalist there as they worked to put out that last issue. And she hears from Helen Davidson, reporting from Taipei, about how events of the past fortnight have unfolded, and the Guardian’s China affairs correspondent, Vincent Ni, about what the closure says about Beijing’s approach to Hong Kong – and what signal it sends to China’s citizens about the perils of dissent.

Dozens of deaths have been linked to a record-breaking heatwave in the western US and Canada. The US president, Joe Biden, has blamed the climate crisis for also causing blackouts and wildfires. In Canada, the temperature hit 49.6C (121.1F) in the town of Lytton, British Columbia.
We would like to hear from those affected as well as those working in the emergency services.

                    <span>Using digital technologies for less complex tasks can improve the lot of call centre workers, increasing job satisfaction and making time for proper interaction with customers
“I really enjoy my job,” says Sarah*, a customer service agent working for a public sector organisation, “but we’re treated terribly.” This statement will not come as a surprise to anyone who has worked in a similar role. Customer service agents typically have gruelling roles and often bear the brunt of people’s anger when things go wrong – even if the fault had nothing to do with them.
The daily deluge of irate and even abusive customers can take its toll, leaving agents feeling anxious and lonely. We spoke to anonymous customer service agents about their experiences and the impacts of doing such a job.

Two things particularly have always drawn me in my work: teenagers and costumes. I am interested in the age, around 16 and 17, that is full of transition. During those years there is confusion everywhere: confusion about roles, confusion about gender. There are a lot of changes for people to deal with.
In 2008, I travelled to Ukraine to take pictures of kids during the week of their prom that marks the end of their school years. They are very young but they are entering a stage in their lives where they are expected to act like adults. The prom is an example of this. They don’t always feel comfortable in the clothes they’re wearing.

                    <span>Maya Wolfe-Robinson visits the Labour-held West Yorkshire seat of Batley and Spen, which votes in an increasingly heated byelection tomorrow
When the Labour candidate Tracy Brabin won the race to be mayor of West Yorkshire in May, it meant she had to give up her seat in parliament representing Batley and Spen. The resulting byelection takes place tomorrow and the race to replace her as MP is far from assured for Labour. Their candidate Kim Leadbeater is sister of Jo Cox, the Batley and Spen MP murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016. 
Maya Wolfe-Robinson tells Anushka Asthana how she has been visiting the constituency for weeks and describes an increasingly fraught campaign, which was upended by the entry of former Labour MP George Galloway into the race. His candidacy threatens to split the Labour vote by appealing directly to the area’s Muslim population on issues such as Palestinian rights and the crisis in Kashmir. Meanwhile, the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson is hoping to benefit from a reduced Labour vote that would allow him to add to Boris Johnson’s majority and take a seat last won by his party in 1992.

They believe it could revolutionise the way we treat those with depression and trauma. But as investors from Silicon Valley become interested in the technology, the pair are fighting to make sure the device is used in the right way and for the right reasons.

                    <span>Boris Johnson has a new health secretary this week after the resignation of the man tasked with leading the government’s Covid response. But there are plenty of unanswered questions, says Jonathan Freedland
When Britain awoke on Friday morning to tabloid pictures of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in a ‘steamy clinch’ with a colleague, it was clear that his career hung by a thread. He had been a harsh critic of other prominent figures breaking lockdown rules, and here was what appeared to be a clear breach of his own social distancing guidelines. Later that day he was given the backing of the prime minister, who considered the matter closed. It was anything but. 
The following morning saw the release of a full CCTV version of the incident in his office, and on the airwaves there was a distinct lack of colleagues willing to support him. Later that day his resignation letter was accepted by Boris Johnson. Hancock was gone.

Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

                    <span>Britney Spears has spoken out publicly for the first time against the controversial legal arrangement that has stripped her of independence for 13 years – and handed control of her estate, career and aspects of her personal life to her father, Jamie Spears, who also at times had authority over her medical and mental health treatment. 

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;

We are also interested in hearing from EU citizens who have wrongly been told by councils, NHS staff or landlords that they are not eligible for a service because they do not yet have settled or pre-settled status, despite being in the process of applying.
