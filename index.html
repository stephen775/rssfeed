New York prosecutors have given lawyers for Donald Trump 24 hours to respond with any last arguments as to why criminal charges should not be filed against his family business, according to a report on Sunday.
The deadline set for Monday was another strong signal that the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, are considering criminal charges against the former president’s company as an entity, according to sources quoted by the Washington Post.

The strength of the UK jobs market and rates of pay has been overstated, according to new research, just as the government prepares to cut back its wage support scheme for furloughed workers this week.
There is a risk of “dangerous complacency”, the Resolution Foundation warned, as people are still working fewer hours than they were before the pandemic and headline pay growth is overstated.

A respiratory crisis in a world tensed by terrorism is among topical themes in this compelling showcase of the playwright’s shorter, earlier works
If Caryl Churchill were a runner, she would hold gold medals for both the 100- and 10,000-metre races. Long-distance pieces (Top Girls, Serious Money) alternate with sprint scripts: What If If Only, a new play at the Royal Court in September, is predicted to last 14 minutes. Later Churchill has also featured meaty evenings – Love and Information and Glass.Kill.Bluebeard.Imp – comprised of short pieces.
Director James Haddrell fascinatingly explores the dramatist’s middle distance by bringing together four of the 10 texts collected in a 1990 anthology, Caryl Churchill: Shorts.

As the reunified service launches on Monday, the chief inspector of probation, Justin Russell, said the move to renationalise the service was welcome but will not be without its challenges.

Korda becomes world number one
Check out the official LPGA leader board

 12.18am BST 
Nelly Korda won her first major title by taking the Women’s PGA Championship by three shots at the Atlanta Athletic Club.
The American, whose victory will see her become world No 1, went into the final day tied for the lead with Lizette Salas but clinched the title with a four-under round of 68.
 11.16pm BST 
Two seemingly effortless eagles won the day for Nelly Korda. The first one, the result of an outrageous 250-yard fairway wood on 5 that nearly rolled in for albatross, coaxed a response out of Lizette Salas ... but Salas couldn’t respond a second time when Korda’s aggressive line at 12 paid a big dividend. Formerly the best player on Tour without a major to her name, Korda is now a PGA champion and world number one. Congratulations to her, commiserations to Salas, and thanks for reading this live blog. Nighty night!

He talks about the journey that brought him here with a directness and determination that helps explain it all. “I’m very happy, enjoying every moment,” he says.

Authorities in Massachusetts are investigating whether a man who killed two people in the Boston suburb of Winthrop on Saturday targeted them because they were Black, after officials found “troubling white supremacist rhetoric” in the gunman’s handwriting, a prosecutor said. 
The Suffolk county district attorney, Rachael Rollins, identified the gunman as 28-year-old Nathan Allen and said investigators uncovered writings that expressed “antisemitic and racist statements against Black individuals”.

Johanna Konta, Britain’s No1 women’s tennis player, has been forced to withdraw from Wimbledon on the eve of the tournament after being deemed a close contact of a member of her team who tested positive for Covid-19.
On Sunday morning a member of Konta’s team developed symptoms of the illness and returned a positive test later in the day. Konta, who had tested negative in her previous tests, will now have to isolate for 10 days. Under grand slam rules she will receive 50% of the £48,000 first-round prize money.

Both men had been withdrawn, injured, now all they could do was watch helpless as their teammates desperately hung on to a Thorgan Hazard goal that would see them go through. If, that was, Portugal couldn’t find a way through – and as the final minutes progressed that must have felt ever more imminent to them, the pressure rising all the time.

Now it is the turn of his partner in, it is charged, all things, Ghislaine Maxwell. She gets a three-hour Sky Documentaries series, Epstein’s Shadow: Ghislaine Maxwell, which itself feels like a shadow of Filthy Rich. The latter was not laden with original insight but did deliver a dense, compact history of the proliferating tales, evidence, rumours and reports that had swirled for decades before Epstein’s arrest for trafficking minors, and subsequent suicide while awaiting trial.
This documentary tells the story of Maxwell’s upbringing as the youngest child of media baron and notorious bully Robert Maxwell, her socialite years and her introduction to and subsequent long relationship with Epstein, which included, many claim, procuring underage girls for him who were then often passed round a network of like-minded men.

The owner of a controversial Flintstones-themed house has settled a lawsuit with the town of Hillsborough, in the San Francisco suburbs, which alleged she violated local codes when she put dinosaur sculptures in the back yard and made other landscaping changes that caused local officials to declare a public nuisance.

Marine Le Pen’s far-right party has suffered a serious electoral blow when it failed to win a regional election in its stronghold in the south of France.
The Rassemblement National (RN) had pinned its last chances on taking the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur region (PACA) after emerging victorious from last week’s first-round vote, although by a small margin.

Thrown by the second half dismissal of Matthijs de Ligt, a Dutch team that came romping out of the blocks in Budapest, all regal vim and pep, was transformed at a stroke into a sagging orange soufflé.

Growing numbers of young adults are suffering from chronic pain that seriously affects their lives, with the rise blamed on obesity, sedentary lifestyles and stresses faced by that age group.
A new report on the prevalence of chronic pain in England has found that the number of people beset with it remained steady between 2011 and 2017 at about 15.5 million. Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts more than 12 weeks despite treatment or medication. Most sufferers have arthritis or musculoskeletal conditions, such as gout and ankylosing spondylitis.

                    <span>The influential experimental US composer ‘celebrated and dignified’ his ‘fourth world’  sources and contributed to albums by Brian Eno and Talking Heads
• Jon Hassell, avant garde US composer, dies aged 84
By the time Jon Hassell became a revered figure – the kind of determinedly non-commercial, avant-garde artist whose ideas are so strong and so forward-thinking they end up influencing the mainstream regardless – he was already middle-aged, but had crammed a lifetime’s worth of musical experience into his 40 years.
He had begun his career as a trumpet player in the swing era – tellingly, his own tastes leaned towards Stan Kenton, among the most progressive and experimental of the big band leaders – before becoming immersed in the cutting edge of modern classical music and moving to Cologne to study under Karlheinz Stockhausen: his fellow pupils included Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, both later of Can. In an early example of his lifelong desire to meld differing musical forms, he began attempting to apply Stockhausen’s tape experiments to recordings of jazz vocal quartet the Hi-Los.

Sajid Javid’s appointment as health secretary replacing Matt Hancock at the Department of Health and Social care comes at a time when, as the British Medical Association put it, he has “probably the most daunting in-tray that any secretary of state for health has ever inherited”.
Covid, the NHS’s unique role in British life and the pressures it is under mean that Javid is now the most high-profile job in the government after the prime minister. Whoever holds the post regularly has to take big, often controversial, decisions.

Along with Nat Sciver (74 not out), the pair added 119 runs in just 116 balls for the third wicket, executing beautiful lofted drives and perfectly-placed sweeps in a dominant display at Bristol.

A leading grime artist and presenter has condemned the lack of meaningful change in the music industry since last summer’s anti-racist protests, and criticised record labels for benefiting from black stars but still failing to invest in and retain black talent behind the scenes.
There was a surge of anger in response to the death of George Floyd across a wide section of British society, especially within the music industry. Many artists and labels took part in #BlackoutTuesday, a social media campaign led by two black music executives in which people posted black squares to stand in solidarity with black people.

                    <span>Grit, hunger, nerves of steel … none of it is evident in a side that lurched through its group. England must ignore the mythology
Let’s try a quick thought exercise. Team A, ranked No 4 in the world, comfortably topped its group and is on a run of nine games without defeat, with a defence that has conceded just five goals in its last 17 matches. Team B, ranked No 12, scraped through its group with four points and wildly inconsistent performances, hasn’t kept a clean sheet in six games and lost 6-0 as recently as November. Team A is playing at home. Who do you think should start as favourites?
Treat this game as a blind taste test, with the labels and the history and the emotional baggage stripped away, and England v Germany feels like a simple enough proposition. It’s by no means a foregone conclusion, but all things being equal England should probably win, especially with home advantage. But of course tournament football, especially at international level, is not played in a vacuum. Mythologies and mentalities matter. Imponderables impinge. History – well, you can embrace it or you can ignore it, but you can’t erase it. It’s there, staring you down, whether you want to look at it or not.

                    <span>Bolly or Veuve Cliquot? If you ever wanted to bluff your way through that baffling list of bubblies, then pick this warm-hearted film   
Irish film producer and distribution executive Frank Mannion makes a genial host and guide to this polished survey of the highest of high-end sparkling wines; it’s entertaining in itself to watch Mannion gulping down giant goblets of the vintage under the guise of interviewing the heads of various champagne houses. There’s very much a wine-tour atmosphere to this documentary, particularly in the first half as Mannion wanders from one vineyard HQ to another, most of them located in gleaming perfume-factory type cubes perched oddly in the French countryside. If you ever thought champagnes were pretty much the same, whatever the label, well, this parade of beautifully turned-out old school champagne-makers will put you straight on the difference between Veuve Cliquot, Pol Roger, Bollinger, and the rest.
In the middle section, Mannion’s attention turns to the beverage’s successful attempts to market itself internationally – “Champagne Charlie”, AKA Charles Heidsieck of Piper Heidsieck renown, appears to be the key figure here – as well as the way champagne has smartly inserted itself into top-end entertainment and sporting events, from James Bond to Wimbledon, to keep its glamour ratings high.

                    <span>Bold climate targets are meaningless without policies to meet them. The PM should grab the chance to make Cop26 a success
Targets are all very well. But not if there is no way of reaching them. In which case, they are a sham. This is the problem now confronting the government. The UK’s stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 78% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels is very ambitious. “Remarkable” was the word used last week by Lord Deben (the former Conservative environment secretary John Gummer). He chairs the climate change committee (CCC) that advises the government. Its latest reports make an unflattering contrast between impressive aims and the absence of plans to meet them.
A strategy setting out how the UK intends to meet its net zero pledge is promised before the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow in November. But there is little sign so far that ministers grasp the scale of the challenge. Not a single government department, the CCC finds, is moving at the necessary pace. Transport, agriculture, buildings, industry: in all the key emissions-producing sectors bar power generation, there has been an alarming lack of progress. Cuts to the aid budget now overseen by the Foreign Office mean that it too is implicated. Support for poor countries as they make the transition away from fossil fuels has long been recognised as a crucial element of the global climate process.

                    <span>We must take care not to devalue a subject that helps us build a more rounded and healthier body politic
Another summer, another dispiriting announcement for English teachers: according to the admissions service Ucas, a third fewer 18-year-olds have applied to study the subject at university this year than in 2012. English academics are beginning to lose their jobs, while one university has paused provision altogether.
Those who teach the subject know why: a championing of science degrees instead of “dead-end courses” (in Gavin Williamson’s widely condemned formulation earlier this year) that has emphasised supposedly superior employability; a galloping instrumentalisation of education; and an alienating set of curriculum reforms. A primary school emphasis on linguistic terminology and an unintuitive approach to sentence construction, brought in under the English graduate Michael Gove, is taken through to GCSE, where coursework and spoken language elements were removed along with popular options in 20th-century American literature and drama. A rise in rote learning has been noted, along with a decline in interest in pupils’ own responses to great literature. The conversion rate from A-level to degree level, 14%, has not changed – underlying the decline in university applications is a slump in the number taking English A-levels.

Sajid Javid is set to announce on Monday that England will wait another three weeks until the final easing of Covid restrictions.
In a statement to the Commons, the new health secretary is expected to confirm that step 4 of lockdown easing will take place on Monday 19 July – in line with the four-week delay from the original target, 21 June – and not Monday 5 July.

Campaigners say many of the estimated 15,000-strong population in the country do not understand that if they do not apply for settled status to the Home Office by Wednesday they will lose their rights.

These are some of the unknowns that MPs will probably be putting to Boris Johnson, who initially stood by Hancock, and the man promoted back into the cabinet to replace him, Sajid Javid, next week.

Nathan Maung, 44, the editor-in-chief of the online news platform Kamayut Media, was detained in a raid on 9 March and freed on 15 June. He said his colleague Hanthar Nyein, who remains in detention, had been tortured more harshly, as had other people he met in prison.

Thousands of people gathered at an illegal rave on farmland in West Sussex overnight, breaching Covid guidelines.
Sussex police said the unlicensed rave had taken place in a remote field forcing multiple road closures in the rural town of Steyning. At least 23 people have been arrested on suspicion of offences including drink and drug-driving, possession of drugs and theft, and have been taken into custody, the force said.

As the inventor of the antivirus software that bears his name, John McAfee, who has died aged 75 after apparently taking his own life in a Spanish prison, turned paranoia into a fortune. He was one of the first successful self-promoting celebrity millionaires whose power and media exposure provide untold influence in the US. 
Moving from computer savant to spiritual guru, he then began an extended second act in Belize, where his outsized lifestyle fuelled his own personal paranoia, and led to his becoming the leading suspect in the murder of a beachfront neighbour.

A wild variety of pas de deux fuel this mixed bill, from kitschy Strauss to a duet with a table, plus part of Sleeping Beauty
Much as happens with real-life weddings, thanks to Covid, the guest list at Princess Aurora’s nuptials has shrunk. A bubble of dancers went into self isolation in the run-up to the Royal Ballet’s latest opening, meaning a hasty reorganisation for some of this mixed bill.
Act three of Sleeping Beauty (performed as a standalone finale, making this a long evening), had a reduced cast but it didn’t dent the star billing, ever-perfect Marianela Nuñez and Vadim Muntagirov, nor Meaghan Grace Hinkis’s noteworthy Princess Florine: animated, technical, musical. Meanwhile, the opener, Anemoi, was reworked at the last minute by Valentino Zucchetti. Expanded from his lockdown piece Scherzo, made for the company’s corps de ballet, the new title refers to the wind gods of Greek myth, and there is an almost visible breeze brushing through the deftly written choreography. Zucchetti favours modest, elegant geometry over the hyper-extended shapes of contemporary ballet and there are some lovely moments where your eyes alight on a particular tableau before everything moves off again.

Mathieu van der Poel, the hugely talented grandson of Tour de France legend, Raymond Poulidor, won the 183.5km second stage of the 2021 race to the steep climb of Mûr-de-Bretagne, to move into the overall lead.
The young Dutch rider has a rich family heritage. His grandfather was known as the “eternal second” – a rival to five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil – who finished on the Tour podium in Paris eight times, although never on the top step. His father Adrie was also a Tour stage winner who wore the yellow jersey, and a world cyclo-cross champion.

Sarah Boseley’s article on the Oxford vaccine story (The Oxford vaccine: the trials and tribulations of a world-saving jab, 26 June) was a huge missed opportunity to get to the real root cause of some of the vaccine’s challenges. Namely, the failure of the UK to invest in pandemic preparedness, specifically vaccine manufacturing, over many years.
Prior to the pandemic, I had sought significant funding to prepare for a disease “X” (like Covid-19) and to develop the manufacturing capacity to produce trial vaccines – neither of which happened. If we had been properly prepared, and not had to make do with what we had in place while in the midst of a lockdown, we would have been much better able to respond. As it is, I am incredibly proud of what has been achieved with more than 500m doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine distributed around the world on a not-for-profit basis.

A study of Twitter messages directed at and naming the England team during the three group stage matches identified more than 2,000 abusive messages, including scores of racist posts.

Hamilton powerless in second, Valtteri Bottas finishes third

His title charge looking increasingly relentless, Max Verstappen’s victory at the Styrian Grand Prix achieved the extraordinary feat of leaving the mighty Mercedes simply impotent. Lewis Hamilton was beaten into second by Verstappen’s Red Bull in a performance the world champion would recognise only too well, having delivered so many similar, inch-perfect, flawless demolitions himself in the past. Moreover this time it was one that may have set Hamilton on a collision course with his own team.
It was the manner of the defeat at the Red Bull Ring that meant so much. Hamilton was left frustrated and powerless in his cockpit, clutching at the forlorn hope of rain and his Mercedes team flailing, ineffectual at influencing events on track other than an equally vain wish that somehow Verstappen’s tyres would wear more swiftly than those of their man.

An 11-year-old primary school pupil was referred to the government’s controversial counter-radicalisation Prevent programme after a teacher mistook the word “alms” for “arms” during a classroom discussion.
The boy’s teacher asked what pupils would do if they found themselves in possession of a lot of money. According to a legal challenge against the school lodged by the boy’s parents, he said he would “give alms to the oppressed”. The teacher interpreted this as “give arms to the oppressed” and made the Prevent referral.

On Sunday the Sun said Alexander was thrashing out final details with the BBC to succeed Jodie Whittaker and become the 14th Doctor.

A drawing bought in a small French sale by a buyer with a hunch has been identified as a rare surviving page from an important notebook made by a young Peter Paul Rubens.
If Rubens’ original Theoretical Notebook still existed it would be a true art wonder, but it was all but destroyed in a fire in 1720. Only two pages were thought to have survived, treasures of collections in London and Berlin.

It’s all down to good breeding and deportment. GodlessHeathens
If you believe pigeons are the most severe example of this behaviour, try chickens. They crane, rotate, jerk and generally goof their necks around even when not walking. I always understood that this is because birds have eyes facing different directions, and so can’t take advantage of the differential we use for depth perception. As keen predators, chickens have to make significant snap judgments about the speed and distance of a target (be it insect, mouse, lizard or indeed something wholly inappropriate such as the neighbour’s cat). Pigeons are not predators, but neither are they ground birds as our modern pests are descended from rock pigeons, so who knows. I would put geese alongside your ducks in birds that don’t jerk as they walk. In my experience, they are usually too busy craning their necks forward and hissing at my ankles. However, they are both grazers or water feeders, so maybe that is it. A parrot will sit on a branch and crane from side to side. Birds are bizarre, and you should not question their motives, lest they destroy you. Lewis Barton

Thirteen months ago, Dominic Cummings faced an avalanche of demands to resign after being caught in an egregious breach of the Covid lockdown regulations. Although Cummings had clearly broken rules that he had helped to draw up, and public opinion was against him, he survived – albeit for only a few months – because Boris Johnson stood behind him.
This weekend, Matt Hancock also had Johnson’s backing. Hancock had also clearly broken his own Covid rules, and faced a hostile media and negative opinion polls. But now Hancock has gone, to be replaced as health secretary by the former chancellor Sajid Javid. This time Johnson’s support was not enough.

Interest in Dogger Bank was once restricted to insomniac enthusiasts for the BBC’s Shipping Forecast. Not any more. Today, the shallow sandbank, located 120 miles off the UK’s north-eastern shoreline, is home to the world’s largest windpower project. When fully operational, giant turbines will transmit 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough to power 5m homes, into the National Grid at prices well below current levels.
Welcome to the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. Around the world, solar and wind now represent the cheapest source of new electricity generation – and prices are tumbling. Electric vehicle (EV) batteries are driving oil towards obsolescence. Stripped of government subsidies and corporate lobbying carbon-based fuels are a busted flush. The future of energy is green – and the future can’t come soon enough to tackle the climate crisis.

It is a strange irony that the thing we want most in life is often that which eludes us. The writer and feminist Rebecca Solnit says, “Often it is the desire between us and the object of desire that fills the space in between with the blue of longing.”
The protagonist in my debut novel, The Imposter, wrestles with the sensation that Solnit describes – that blue of longing. She travels on the top deck of the bus in the city where she lives, glancing into the cosy living room windows she passes, filled with seemingly happy families, and longs to be a part of one of them.

                    <span>Peter Bradshaw chats with his predecessor Derek Malcolm about routes into the profession, screenings and social media
From 1999 until the present, I have been the chief film critic of the Guardian; before that it was the legendary Derek Malcolm who held the job from the early 70s, and now at the age of 89, is far from retired, regularly attending festivals including Venice and Goa, and contributing to the Sky Arts TV show Discovering Film. 
How has the job of film critic changed between his day and mine? I went down for lunch and a comparison of notes with Derek at his house in Deal, Kent, where he lives with his wife, the historian and journalist Sarah Gristwood. 
How did Derek get into the film critic business? “I was on the Gloucestershire Echo and wrote to Brian Redhead, who was the Manchester Guardian’s arts editor, asking if I could write about the Cheltenham literary festival. He said I might send my piece in and it was published, and he told me to come and see him. I knew Redhead was a socialist and if he knew I was at Eton and Oxford I would never get a job. So he asked me where I went to school and I said: ‘Somewhere near Slough.’ I ended up as a designer, and then called down to London where I was the late-night sub and the only one who could read the reviews by Neville Cardus [the renowned music critic and cricket correspondent] who submitted his copy in longhand. I became the letters editor, and – because I had been an amateur jockey in the 1960s — the racing correspondent. 
“I was also the deputy drama critic to Philip Hope-Wallace, who took great delight in sending me to review Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs. I became the film critic because the editor fired the existing critic, Richard Roud, for writing a one-word review of The Sound of Music — he just wrote ‘No’. Just that.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

The transmission advantage of the Delta variant that is spreading at pace globally is a sign that the race between vaccination and the virus could tip in favour of the latter unless countries ramp up their immunisation campaigns and practise caution, scientists say.
The variant, first detected in India, has been identified in at least 92 countries and is considered the “fittest” variant yet of the virus that causes Covid-19, with its enhanced ability to prey on the vulnerable – particularly in places with low vaccination rates.

                    <span>The trustees all voted for the ex-chancellor as their chair. It’s all about power and money
The appointment of George Osborne as chair of trustees at the British Museum is a startling jolt. The taint is so obvious, the associations so indelible: can it really have come to this? You do not have to recall the former chancellor’s austerity measures with horror to be dismayed; nor even his notorious cuts to the museum sector, pertinent as one certainly hopes they were during the selection process. Osborne was a career politician, after all. But the flagrant opportunism, the conspicuous needling, sneering and condescension made him unpopular even among members of his own party.
About the selection, questions have inevitably been raised. Where was the advertisement? Could anyone apply? Who chose him and what were his qualifications (as negligible, to critics, as for his recent role as Standard editor)? Surely he was another Tory placeman, like Jacob Rees-Mogg at the National Portrait Gallery, or Tory donor Richard Sharp as the new BBC chair?

                    <span>Ripples in spacetime caused by the collision of black holes were first detected in 2015. Now astrophysicists are looking for the waves created by the big bang itself
About 10 billion-trillion-trillionths of a second into the start of creation in the big bang, the universe is believed to have had a brief but absurdly fast growth spurt. This episode, called inflation, was so cataclysmic that the very fabric of space and time was set juddering with gravitational waves (GWs). By comparison, the GWs that were first detected six years ago to much fanfare were small-scale affairs caused by black holes colliding. But now scientists at the European Space Agency (Esa) are setting their sights on grander targets – and are hoping they might soon be able to detect the faint echoes of the universe’s inflationary birth throes, almost 14bn years after the event, using the largest instrument ever built. Hundreds of times bigger than the Earth, Esa’s planned gravitational wave detector will float in space and look for wobbles in spacetime caused by all manner of immense astrophysical convulsions.
The first GW was identified in 2015 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo), an international project whose success won the 2017 Nobel prize in physics for three of its key proponents. Ligo consists of two massive detectors in the American states of Washington and Louisiana. Each deploys two tunnels 2.5 miles (4km) long, intersecting at a right angle, along which a laser beam travels to a mirror at the far end and bounces back. The returning light waves interfere with one another where the arms cross. As a GW passes, it very slightly contracts or stretches spacetime. Because that effect will be different in each arm, it changes the synchrony of the light waves, and so alters the interference of the two beams.

Canada urgently needs an independent investigation into the deaths of thousands of Indigenous children at church-run residential schools if the country ever hopes to finally confront the horrors of its colonial past, the man who led the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has told the Guardian.
Murray Sinclair, a former senator and one of the country’s first Indigenous judges, warned that the “undiscovered truths” of the schools are probably far more devastating than many Canadians realize – including the deliberate killing of children by school staff and the likelihood that such crimes were covered up.

                    <span>Lauded for centuries but a puzzle for many readers, The Anatomy of Melancholy has at last been demystified
 Admired by everyone from John Milton to Nick Cave, The Anatomy of Melancholy has always been a text that has dazzled and confounded its readers in equal measure.
Now, exactly 400 years after it was published, an academic has painstakingly traced the meaning of thousands of its sphinxlike allusions, enigmatic references and arcane quotations, allowing Robert Burton’s famous text to be fully understood for the very first time.

                    <span>From ‘ladette’ to the highest-paid woman at the BBC, the nation’s cheerer-upper talks about her long and colourful journey to the top of radio
The other day Zoë Ball’s 20-year-old son, Woody, from her marriage to Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim), was home from university and rummaging through his mum’s house. “He found some stuff in my office,” says Ball, “and he was like, ‘Oh my God, you and Dad were, like, a big thing back in the day.” We are sitting in an empty restaurant near BBC Broadcasting House in London, and Ball’s eyes are a mixture of amusement and horror as she recalls her son’s discovery. She speaks in a surprisingly hushed manner given that there is nobody else in the room. “There was a time when I found looking back to the 90s a little bit… tricky,” she says, with a diplomatic tone.
When her kids (Ball and Cook also have a daughter, Nelly, 11) ask about it, she isn’t entirely keen to reminisce, although she recently turned 50 and appreciates having such distance from her wilder youth. “Woody says, ‘You had so much fun! Tell the story about this,’ and we groan and say, ‘Ugh you don’t want to hear about that.’ And he says, ‘I do, I want to hear the story.’ So our kind-of extended family tell him the tales. My friends say, ‘Let me tell you about the time your mother was…’” she tries to think of something printable to say. “‘On roller skates.’ Whatever.” She also sometimes finds old photographs and wails: “‘God I was so thin!’ I look back and I was dangerously gaunt. Not that that’s good – that’s not good. But we didn’t stop.”

                    <span>Oliver Dowden’s privatisation wheeze is surely a post-truth provocation
Last week, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, opportunistically pretended to have bailed out a picturesque Cornish theatre that had, like most arts practitioners, received nothing from him. Also last week, Dowden was outlining his plans for privatising Channel 4 in a piece penned for the Times, hidden behind the paywall. Dowden’s favourite kind of policy announcement is the kind of policy announcement you have to pay for. So I snatched up the Times from my newsagent’s counter, the first hard copy I had read since it declared me “the world’s greatest living standup comedian” in 2018. Dowden’s words were reassuringly expensive, like luxury Stella Artois. My newsagent, Ranking Newsman the News Selector, remembered the old days when the younger me would buy every non-Guardian newspaper in his shop and methodically burn them in the council dog mess bin outside. He wryly remarked that a man gets more right wing as he gets older.
Dowden’s first two paragraphs were blandly plausible. Then he patronisingly cited I May Destroy You and It’s a Sin as examples of shows by public broadcasters that “hold their own”. But the subject material of these acclaimed dramas – race, gender, sexuality and rape – is exactly the kind of woke content commercially driven producers would historically not commission, content that Channel 4 was explicitly established to create. Indeed, 20 years ago, the anti-woke Daily Mail wrote that woke It’s a Sin creator Russell T Davies’s 1999 drama, Queer as Woke, proved woke television needed to be actively censored. Beck’s beer even withdrew its sponsorship of the woke series, as it has every right so to do.

                    <span>We are all belittled by those determined to push partisan rightwing views
After five years, the biggest casualties of Brexit are in plain sight. Integrity and decency in public life are crumbling. Because so much of the case for Brexit is false, the political modus operandi of the Brexiters, now dominating our political culture, has become a refusal to accept responsibility for mistakes, overclaiming, deceit and sometimes outright lies to justify the unjustifiable. Once the electorate can no longer trust what they are told, democratic debate is denied. We have been robbed of a core right of citizenship.
It is a form of coup, but with a cloud of nationalist hyperbole disguising the threat to parliamentary democracy. To hold power, or challenge it, in a democracy requires continual argument and discussion, the precondition of which is a commitment to truth-telling and a shared acceptance of facts, however differently they may be interpreted. Trash those preconditions and we inevitably slide into a universe of division and distrust impervious to rational argument. We are all belittled.

Anne Robinson, 76, was born in Crosby, north of Liverpool, to Irish parents. She started out as the first female trainee on the Daily Mail, and developed her trademark caustic style while writing the Daily Mirror’s “Wednesday Witch” column. She began appearing on TV during the 80s, becoming presenter of Points of View and Watchdog. Robinson is best known for the BBC gameshow The Weakest Link, and tomorrow takes over as the new host of Countdown, which airs at 2.10pm every weekday on Channel 4.
How does it feel to be returning to the world of quizshows?
I stopped doing The Weakest Link a decade ago when it moved up to Glasgow – my grandchildren had just been born and I didn’t want to be that far away – but I adored every single episode I did. When Countdown came along, it felt like a brilliant fit. It didn’t take me any time at all to say yes.

Heading back to their student halls with a bottle of wine, 19-year-olds Roz Monaghan and Mackenzie Bradley-Wilkinson are feeling tense. The pair live in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, where Covid-19 rates are the highest in the country, more than 10 times the average.
A combination of a majority-unvaccinated population, a return to face-to-face teaching, good weather and the end of exams has sent Covid rates in Leeds’s student area sky-high.

With its high ceilings, white walls and bleached pine furniture it could be one of the many artist’s studios or galleries that dot this corner of central Berlin. A grey curtain with plastic holes, stitched together by Franco-Italian artist Céline Condorelli, snakes between desks to divide the room into public and private spaces.
In fact, this second-floor space inside a beige brick former soap factory is something closer to a newsroom or a detective agency, tripling up as a lawyers’ chambers. Next month it will formally be launched as the home of the Investigative Commons, a kind of super-hub for organisations whose work has revolutionised the field of human rights activism.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s association with Jeffrey Epstein began years earlier than previously understood, according to a documentary investigating the socialite who became an alleged procuress for the paedophile financier.
The new information challenges the common assumption that Epstein stepped into a vacuum in her life after the death of her father, the newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, who was found in the sea near the Canary Islands in 1991.

Welcome to the summer of love. The Whoring 20s, Shot Girl Summer, the smell of meat and lotion. A bus passed by yesterday, its side painted with an advert encouraging passersby to “vax, wax and relax”. The new sexual revolution is here, and all it took was a deadly pandemic and a year indoors. It’s true, it’s coming, look, there!
Big women swaggering through a pollarded boulevard, feeling themselves like they’ve never feeled before, suited men singing soul songs under their breath, teenagers standing so close they’re talking in each other’s voices. There’s a picnic by the swings where someone has served themself with mayonnaise on a soft baguette. In the supermarket, women stand mesmerised by the erotic hum of a freezer, and someone inhales the cut flowers with a heavy-lidded smile, and a man gruffly counts peaches. A parking attendant kisses his own lips, the tune of an ice-cream van sounds drunk and yearning. When did everyone get a body? When did everyone descend from the live-work space of their minds and knock through to the basement of those hips, that hair?

A MailOnline headline on 13 June read: “Study shows 29% of the 42 people who have died after catching the new strain had BOTH vaccinations.” In Public Health England’s technical briefing on 25 June, that figure had risen to 43% (50 of 117), with the majority (60%) having received at least one dose.
It could sound worrying that the majority of people dying in England with the now-dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant have been vaccinated. Does this mean the vaccines are ineffective? Far from it, it’s what we would expect from an effective but imperfect vaccine, a risk profile that varies hugely by age and the way the vaccines have been rolled out.

It’s a boiling hot day in rural Berkshire, and a man in navy satin Gucci shorts has just walked into his library. It’s all ornate chairs, wooden globes and Buddhist statues, its oiled shelves lined with books about history, the arts – and tons about music. The scene is one of airy tranquillity, the perfect place for two culture-loving good friends to hole up for a chat.
One of them isn’t here yet – he’s popped to the bathroom after having his photo taken – but Elton John can’t stop raving about John Grant. “We have so many things in common – photography, art, music – it’s as if we’ve known each other for ever. And he’s fun!” Grant wanders in shyly in a pink baseball cap, weathered Talk Talk T-shirt, and glossy white DMs. “Much more fun than his records are anyway, haha.”

                    <span>As a schoolboy, Adam Andrusier was passionate about collecting the autographs of the rich and famous, then later it became his full-time career. But what was he hoping to find on all those scraps of paper?
It was 1989. I had my schoolbag over my shoulder, a blank piece of card in one hand, a ballpoint in the other. An autograph pen pal of mine had informed me that Paul McCartney would be performing an unplugged session at a recording studio in Wembley, so I hotfooted it there after school. McCartney was autograph royalty, a god. Ultra-tricky through the mail, he signed very little and his squiggle on a piece of paper was worth £100 even back then. The guy could literally write his own money.
If this worked out, I mused, if I actually met a Beatle after school, I’d surely have arrived. It would be like that scene in The Ten Commandments when Charlton Heston comes upon the burning bush on Mount Horeb. “I am here,” I’d announce humbly, just like Charlton. He and I had both been born into bondage-type situations, after all – his, the ancient Egyptian kind, mine more modern Jewish suburban. I’d be scared at first; I’d hide my face from the orange Beatle haze, but then I’d fall to my knees on the Wembley industrial estate and cower in the presence of true greatness.

For Sara Gibbs, her diagnosis of autism at the age of 30 was like the final scene of the 1999 movie The Sixth Sense when Bruce Willis realises he is a ghost. “It was a revelation. Once I understood what autism was, there was no hesitation. I was like: ‘Yep, that’s me, 100%, there’s no two ways about it.’”
Not only did she suddenly understand herself, she also had a new understanding of her father, who had died of cancer a few years before Gibbs’ diagnosis. “His rages were, very clearly to me now, autistic meltdowns. He didn’t understand it, and I didn’t understand it. Growing up, I thought my dad hated me. I don’t believe that, but he couldn’t cope with noise, and I couldn’t stop making noise – and our autistic traits were setting each other off. And if we’d known, we might have known how to manage it.”

                    <span>Photographer Jake Michaels captures the tension between tradition and technology in the Christian community
In 2018, the Los Angeles-based photographer Jake Michaels escaped from Instagram and 24-hour news for a while, to go in search of a community with a different sense of time. A colleague had suggested that he visit the Mennonite settlements in Belize, which were established in the middle of the last century and have hardly changed since. Michaels arrived among homesteads set in lush green hills in the twilight and the village pastor gave him permission to photograph the community’s families. He was struck by the silence, only interrupted by the sound of horses’ hooves and the wooden wheels of the buggies they pulled. He stayed for a long week.
The result of that trip is a book titled c1950 that captures the ways in which the Mennonites, an Anabaptist Christian sect, believe that they should be “in the world but not of it”. Their lives are based on principles of agrarian cooperation and mutual aid: older children take care of younger ones; neighbours are always on hand to fix farm equipment or help out with a harvest. The Belize government allows the group to live mostly independently on their own land; young men are not called up for national service and children are educated in line with the community faith.

                    <span>The private hostels are meant to care for vulnerable homeless people. But as crime soars, users suffer and neighbours despair, questions are being asked
Ela Sozeri felt hopeful when she was sent to a privately owned hostel in Birmingham, where support staff promised to help get her life back on track. She dreams of one day setting up her own craft business but has been held back by mental health problems and spells of homelessness. Yet her stay soon turned into a terrifying ordeal, which left her and her boyfriend cowering in their rooms in fear.
“When they showed us around, they told us we would get daily contact and support. But we actually didn’t get any [proper support],” she said. “We’ve only had problems here because the other tenants were heroin and crack users. We’re here because of emotional difficulties and having nowhere to live – not for drugs or anything like that.”

                    <span>Whatever your view on sex and gender, freedom of speech is key
Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy, which cannot flourish unless citizens can articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship or sanction. So it should concern anyone who claims to be a democrat that there is growing evidence that women who have expressed a set of feminist beliefs that have come to be known as “gender-critical” have, in some cases, faced significant professional penalties as a result.
“Gender-critical” beliefs refer to the view that someone’s sex – whether they are male or female – is biological and immutable and cannot be conflated with someone’s gender identity, whether they identify as a man or a woman. The belief that the patriarchal oppression of women is grounded partly in their biological sex, not just the social expression of gender, and that women therefore have the right to certain single-sex spaces and to organise on the basis of biological sex if they so wish, represents a long-standing strand of feminist thinking. Other feminists disagree, believing that gender identity supersedes biological sex altogether.

The question Last year, a friend asked me to become part of a Go Fund Me drive to raise money for her medical treatment. At first I and other friends sprang into action, but later we began to question our (and her) actions. 
Many years ago, this friend had an illness she recovered from after gruelling treatment. Then she was diagnosed with a recurrence and treated successfully, again. Her illness (or perhaps the fear of it returning) has been the dominant focus of her life. Then she told me she had had some troubling news regarding a new diagnosis – and the Go Fund Me drive was started. But it later transpired the money was not for any kind of last-ditch experimental treatment and that she had opted for an elective operation at a private hospital as a precautionary measure.

Just as the Inuit are reputed to have many words for snow, so the people of Sussex, both East and West, are said to have many words for mud. A lot of them have a pleasing onomatopoeic squelch. There is “gawm”, for the nastiest-smelling kind of mud and “stodge” for the thickest pudding-like type. There is “swank” for a muddy bog and “stug” for watery mud, and “gubber” for a trench of rotting matter. I like the industrious, grinding Sussex represented by this nerdy vocabulary. People who work the land need the brevity provided by such words.

                    <span>Vija Skangale, a curator, grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the 1980s, and now lives in London. One day, looking through childhood photos, she found an image of her four-year-old self atop a papier-mache horse at the local zoo. “All my Tbilisi friends have a similar photo,” she says, “but I knew nothing about the photographer.” So she posted on social media and was overwhelmed by the response. “People shared their own pictures and I connected with the photographer’s grandson.” She discovered that the pictures, roughly dating from 1960 to 2013, were taken by local photographer Victor Sukiasov, who had destroyed his archive before he died. This haunted Skangale: “I decided to honour his legacy, even though he didn’t think what he did was meaningful.” She set up a digital archive so that anyone can upload their own Sukiasov portrait with his prop horse. “Thousands have sat for him and will have memories triggered by looking at his work. I think collective memory is important.”

                    <span>Now more than ever, novelists are facing up to the unthinkable: the climate crisis. Claire Armitstead talks to Margaret Atwood, Amitav Ghosh and more about the new cli-fi
In September 2017, David Simon, creator of The Wire, tweeted a photograph of golfers calmly lining up their putts on an Oregon course as wildfires raged in the background. “In the pantheon of visual metaphors for America today, this is the money shot,” he wrote of the picture, which was taken by an amateur photographer who spotted the photo-op as she was about to skydive out of a plane. Everything about this story – the image, the circumstances – seems stranger than fiction.
A year before Simon’s tweet, in a landmark polemic, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh had questioned why so few writers – himself included – were tackling the world’s most pressing issue in their fiction. But now, as extreme weather swirls around the globe, melting glaciers, burning forests, flooding districts and annihilating species, the climate emergency has brought the unimaginable into our daily lives and literature. A survivor in Jessie Greengrass’s haunting new novel The High House sums it up: “The whole complicated system of modernity which had held us up, away from the earth, was crumbling … and we were becoming again what we had used to be: cold, and frightened of the weather, and frightened of the dark. Somehow while we had all been busy, while we had been doing those small things which added up to living, the future had slipped into the present.”

There’s no denying that weddings are joyful, but they also come freighted with a list of unwritten rules, which guests should obey but often breach.
Of course, during the pandemic, weddings and other significant life events, from civil partnerships to funerals, baptisms, barmitzvahs and batmitzvahs, have been governed by another, tougher but necessary, set of guidelines: downsized guest numbers, hand sanitisation after exchanging rings, fathers walking their daughters down the aisle 1 metre apart.

                    <span>On the first day of Pride month, the governor of Florida signed a law banning transgender girls from joining girls’ sports teams in schools and colleges. It was just one of 13 anti-trans bills conservative lawmakers in the US passed this year – and one of more than 110 proposed bills, many of which also target access to gender-affirming healthcare. This is by far the largest number filed in a single year in US history.
Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

                    <span>From a leadership fiasco to the ‘sausage wars’, the Democratic Unionist party’s stance on Brexit has forced it to contend with a new – perhaps even existential – set of problems. What will they mean for the region’s future?
When the Democratic Unionist party decided to support Brexit, many warned that the decision could have profound consequences for Northern Ireland’s position within the UK. Five years on, new customs arrangements and an Irish Sea border mean trade flows with the Republic of Ireland are growing – even as imports from Great Britain are slowing. And some on the unionist side fear that bit by bit, the argument for a united Ireland is gaining ground.
Now the region has found itself in the grip of a so-called ‘sausage war’ over chilled processed meats. At the same time, the DUP is about to install its third leader in a month, a crisis at the top that has exacerbated fears that the party could face electoral annihilation. Anushka Asthana speaks to the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, and the Brexit correspondent, Lisa O’Carroll, about a seismic moment for Northern Ireland – and what a political crisis for Stormont’s leading unionist party could mean for the region’s future.

                    <span>Britney Spears has spoken out publicly for the first time against the controversial legal arrangement that has stripped her of independence for 13 years – and handed control of her estate, career and aspects of her personal life to her father, Jamie Spears, who also at times had authority over her medical and mental health treatment. 

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: &#x27;I just want my life back.&#x27;
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.

The Sustainable Market Initiative Insurance Taskforce – comprising bosses from 17 firms including Legal &amp; General, Allianz, Hiscox and Axa – has pledged to support the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy by expanding insurance coverage for projects such as offshore windfarms, and partnering with governments to provide better disaster protection cover in countries facing serious risks like extreme weather caused by global heating.

On 28 May 2016 the photographer Jeff McCurry was taking pictures of a 17-year-old western lowland gorilla called Harambe in Cincinnati zoo when a child entered the enclosure. The zookeepers reacted by shooting the gorilla dead. The child was unhurt. What was a local story suddenly became a global phenomenon due to the combination of social media and McCurry’s picture. Harambe’s image was everywhere. But, despite his photo being shared billions of times, McCurry did not see much of a financial benefit. Now advances in technology have given the world non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – and McCurry has a way of finally cashing in on his famous image.
The Guardian’s technology editor, Alex Hern, tells Rachel Humphreys that this year’s craze for NFTs follows in the wake of speculation on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Now similar technology means unique images, film clips, animations and even poems are being bought and sold online for increasingly large sums.

                    <span>The brutal murder of a private investigator in 1987 has become the UK’s most investigated killing – but 34 years later it remains unsolved and mired in new official findings of police corruption
On 10 March 1987, a 37-year-old private investigator named Daniel Morgan was found dead in a south London pub car park with an axe embedded in his head. Despite the arrests of several men, the initial investigation did not lead to any charges and the murder has gone unsolved amid allegations of police corruption. 
The Metropolitan police have previously accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers. But a new panel inquiry concluded last week that the crime was probably “solvable” had it not been undermined. The force was described as “institutionally corrupt” and its commissioner, Cressida Dick, personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry.

From 2030, new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned in Britain – a sure sign that we’re on the threshold of a transport revolution. But what exactly will this revolution look like? With estimates that the market for autonomous vehicles could be worth almost £42bn in just over a decade, the future of transport looks to be anything but boring. Here are five things you need to know …
Driverless cars take to the roads
While fully autonomous vehicles (where the driver could, in theory, watch a film while the vehicle takes the controls) are still a way off, the first driverless cars – with automated lane-keeping systems that allow drivers to safely take their hands off the wheel – could be on Britain’s roads this year. In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix. The road to the driverless future may still be a little bumpy, but it is showing signs of smoothing out.
