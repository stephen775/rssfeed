                    <span>Beijing responds to Nanaia Mahuta’s concerns that New Zealand faces a ‘storm’ of anger from China amid rising Asia-Pacific tensions 
China has urged New Zealand to work in “the same direction, make the pie of cooperation bigger, rise above external distractions”, in response to comments made by foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta in a Guardian interview.
Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said that progress in relations could be achieved “on the premise that the two sides have long been committed to mutual respect, mutual trust and win-win results”. He urged Wellington to work with China to advance a “comprehensive strategic partnership”.

An ad campaign telling the public that “it’s time to buy” bitcoin has been banned after the advertising watchdog ruled that it was irresponsible and misleading.
The high-profile campaign, which has featured heavily across the London underground and the capital’s bus network since December, ran with the strapline “If you’re seeing bitcoin on the underground, it’s time to buy”.

The Department for Education had no plan for dealing with a pandemic and failed to set standards for remote learning during lockdown, leading to “unequal experiences” for many children, according to a critical report by MPs.
Parliament’s public accounts committee also said there was evidence that the government’s £1.7bn catch-up programme – designed to restore the learning lost during school closures – may not be connecting with many of the most disadvantaged children. The committee’s report describes the DfE as having “worthy aspirations but little specific detail”.

Major businesses and investors in the world’s largest economies should brace themselves for a turbulent transition to a low-carbon future because none of the G20 countries are on track to meet their climate ambitions, according to a new report.
There is “no longer any realistic chance” for an orderly transition for global financial markets because political leaders will be forced to rely on “handbrake” policy interventions to cut emissions, according to research from risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

Black, Asian and disabled tenants are disproportionately likely to face discrimination looking for a home, and to end up inhabiting shoddy, unsafe and unsuitable accommodation, according to the housing charity Shelter.
Its survey of 13,000 people’s housing experiences suggests that overall 17.5 million people are affected by what the charity calls the “housing emergency” – meaning they live in housing that is substandard or hazardous, unaffordable, or unfit for their needs.

In the joint letter to the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, the three commissioners – respectively Sally Holland, Bruce Adamson and Koulla Yiasouma – argue the policy is a “clear breach of children’s human rights”.

Working families have come under increasing financial pressure during the last 25 years from soaring property prices, private sector rent hikes and crippling childcare costs, according to the first major analysis of official figures released last month, which shows the UK’s poverty rate among working households last year reached a record high this century.
An increase in relative poverty from 13% in 1996 to 17.4% of working households in the year to March 2020 illustrates the combination of low wage rises and spiralling cost of living faced by a group that Theresa May described when she was prime minister as the “just about managing”.

The property website Zoopla said its projections indicated the property market in 2021 was on course to be the busiest for 14 years.

Body-swap comedies are big in the cinema. From the mother-daughter switch of Freaky Friday to the boy who finds himself an adult in Big, Hollywood loves to show what the world looks like through someone else’s eyes.
Safe to say, however, that few such movies concern the transformation of Hindu gods into street-smart hedonists. And a dead cert that none of them takes place in Dundee.

Persepolis and Isfahan are dazzlingly brought to life in a blockbuster show that explores five jaw-dropping millennia of cultural history, from soaring domes to charging horses


Typical. You go for months without any culture, then 5,000 years of it come along at once. That’s what the V&amp;A’s luxury coach tour of a blockbuster promises, and delivers, including quite brilliant recreations of Iran’s two most renowned sites, Persepolis and Isfahan. Epic Iran shows there is a cultural history that connects the country as it is today with the people who lived here five millennia ago. To put this in perspective, that’s like telling the story of Britain from before Stonehenge to the present and hoping it all connects up somehow. But in Iran, it does.
That’s partly because of a pride in history that preserved traditions across the millennia. The most important document of that is The Shahnameh, The Book of Kings, written at the start of the 11th century CE by the poet Ferdowsi. Iran had been converted to Islam in the seventh century, but Ferdowsi’s epic is packed with the heroic deeds and bloody battles of the ancient, pre-Islamic Sasanian empire. It is also written in Persian, as opposed to Arabic. There are gorgeous manuscripts of this classic. A masterpiece made in Tabriz in the 1500s for the Safavid ruler is open on a battle scene in which bejewelled horsemen charge each other across a sea-like expanse of blue: the painter takes time to depict little flowers blooming on the battlefield, just before the horses trample them.

Gareth Southgate has opened the door to including Trent Alexander-Arnold as one of four right-backs in England’s final squad for Euro 2020 and has insisted he still has a good relationship with the Liverpool defender.
Alexander-Arnold, controversially dropped for the World Cup qualifiers in March, has a chance of making it to this summer’s finals after he was included in a provisional 33-man squad Southgate, who has picked a large squad because of injury concerns and the involvement of key players in the Champions League and Europa League finals this week, did not rule out picking the 22-year-old, suggesting that his place in the squad does not necessarily depend on one of Kyle Walker, Reece James and Kieran Trippier dropping out.

Johnson – along with ministers, government scientific advisers and civil servants – is braced for a lambasting from the man who was his most senior adviser until November, when Cummings is questioned by MPs on Wednesday.

                    <span>Performers from the hits Hamilton, Pretty Woman and Back to the Future consider theatre’s comeback and the shows they can’t wait to see
We thought we’d be home for a couple of weeks when theatres closed last March. Then maybe a couple of months. We kept shifting our expectations. A lot of people aren’t returning to the business, whether that’s through the emotional toll or a lack of financial support. Everybody has a different breaking point. I feel cautiously optimistic that we will rebuild better and take care of each other, but it’s still scary and uncertain.

Hospitals have been accused of “unnecessary secrecy” for refusing to disclose how many of their patients died after catching Covid on their wards.
The Patients Association, doctors’ leaders and the campaign group Transparency International have criticised the 42 NHS acute trusts in England that did not comply fully with freedom of information request for hospital-acquired Covid infections and deaths.

                    <span>Far from minimal disruption, the full impact of leaving the EU may take 15 years to appear
Teething problems? Bumps in the road? The consequences of adjusting to life outside the EU in the midst of a pandemic are starting to become clear. Official figures show a drop in EU trade of almost a quarter at the start of 2021 compared with the same period three years ago.
Far from the “minimal” disruption observed by ministers earlier this year, the figures confirm Brexit came with reasonably substantial short-term costs. It turns out that handing exporters reams of paperwork and border checks on EU shipments, just as the pandemic worsened, isn’t an ideal recipe for a booming global Britain.

Ministers were forced to climb down on travel restrictions to English Covid hotspots after a day of mounting confusion and anger left millions of people wondering if they needed to cancel bank holiday plans.
Contentious advice will be removed from the government website, a spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday evening. It had advised against all but essential travel to and from eight areas of England where the Covid variant identified in India has been spreading. Instead, people will be advised to “minimise travel”.

The US will reopen a mission in Jerusalem to manage diplomatic relations with Palestinians, which had been downgraded by the Trump administration, the US secretary of state has said.
On a trip to the Middle East designed to shore up last week’s ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, Antony Blinken also announced the Biden administration would ask Congress for $75m (£53m) in aid for Palestinians, including $5.5m in immediate aid for rebuilding Gaza. He had earlier pledged at a meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that the US would not allow Hamas to benefit from those funds.

Liverpool look set to complete a £35m move for the RB Leipzig defender Ibrahima Konaté with Jürgen Klopp deciding against a permanent transfer for Ozan Kabak.
The France Under-21 international, who turned 22 on Tuesday, has been a long-term target of Liverpool and, having qualified for next season’s Champions League, Klopp has been given the green light for the deal. The club are on the verge of triggering the release clause of €41m (£35.5m), which must be paid in one lump sum.

                    <span>Joe Biden wants people to come together over racial issues while Boris Johnson wants them to come apart
A year ago George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was murdered in Minneapolis in the US, leading to worldwide protests about racial inequality. Mr Floyd’s death by asphyxiation, filmed in awful graphic detail by a bystander, changed America. The policeman who killed Mr Floyd was, unusually, convicted of murder. In the US, institutions have had to take long, hard looks at themselves. Within months, a hundred Confederate symbols had been removed, relocated or renamed. President Joe Biden promised to end a culture of systemic racism. In Britain, by contrast, the government has shamefully sought to demonise the cause of racial justice for political gain.
Hundreds of anti-racism rallies, in small towns and big cities, sprang up in Britain last summer. In Bristol, a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave merchant, was toppled. After posting a carefully phrased “I hear you” message in the black community newspaper the Voice, Boris Johnson switched tack. He tweeted that removing statues was to “lie about our history”, focusing on graffiti daubed on Winston Churchill’s Westminster plinth.

                    <span>The government’s shambolic presentation of new guidelines for certain areas undermines the fight to control the B.1.617.2 variant
During the first phase of the Covid pandemic, councils were driven to despair by the government’s failure to consult with them adequately or utilise local public health expertise. Last May, for example, as infection rates spiralled in the north-east, numerous northern councils defied Whitehall’s decree that all primary school reception classes should reopen. A dysfunctional relationship between Whitehall and local government undermined the national response to the crisis.
One year on, as concerns continue to grow over the B.1.617.2 variant of the virus, first detected in India, it is astonishing to see the same mistake being made all over again. On Monday night it emerged that new government guidance was issued last week for eight areas affected by the new variant, where surge testing and vaccinations have been taking place. The fresh advice, which would have major implications for millions of people, recommended that all non-essential travel in and out of the places concerned should be avoided, and people should meet outside rather than inside. But this major policy shift, which appeared to amount to a form of light local lockdown, was not communicated to local public health directors, council leaders or businesses. It simply appeared, unannounced, on the government’s Covid guidance website. The public health director of North Tyneside had spent the early part of this week reassuring regional media that it was “certainly OK” to visit the area. In Leicester, also on the list, 8,000 people attended a Premier League football match on Saturday. Yasmin Qureshi, the MP for Bolton South East, found out about the guidance from a local journalist.

Iran’s leadership has been accused of a transparent fix after most prominent reformists were barred from running in next month’s presidential elections, leaving one of the most politically constrained fields in the 41-year history of the republic.
Delaying the announcement to the last minute, the country’s 12-strong Guardian Council – the body that vets candidates – barred most reformist or centrist candidates, leaving a field of seven, largely made up of hard-liners. The manipulation was so clear that even one of the candidates likely to benefit most, Ebrahim Raisi, the current head of the judiciary, claimed he was trying to persuade the council to rethink. Raisi said he was conducting consultations to make the election more participatory and competitive.

Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP for Warrington North, said she was a survivor of sexual assault after an urgent question prompted by the Guardian’s revelation on Monday that fewer than one in 60 rape cases recorded by the police last year in England and Wales resulted in a suspect being charged in 2020.

The extraordinary circumstances of Pratasevich’s involuntary homecoming have provoked international outrage, after his Ryanair flight was forced on Sunday to land in Belarus’s capital Minsk. It was on its way from Greece to Lithuania, where Pratasevich was living.

                    <span>Exclusive: figure based on results of Guardian investigation likely to be an underestimate

Coronavirus – latest updates
See all our coronavirus coverage

At least 77,000 hospital staff in England caught coronavirus during the pandemic, while there were nearly a quarter of a million absences for Covid-related reasons, Guardian research has revealed.
However, the true totals are likely to be much higher, because out of the 142 acute and specialist trusts in England sent freedom of information requests, only 55% (78) provided figures on staff who were infected, while 60% (85) gave data on time off for sick leave related to the virus.

                    <span>Vaccines minister forced to answer an urgent question about new Covid guidance for eight regions

You’re worried about the rate of infection in Covid hotspot areas. So what would you do? A) Get in touch with local leaders and health chiefs to agree extra local restrictions. B) Nothing and hope it goes away. Or C) Slip out some new guidance on the government website when no one is looking on a Friday night and express total surprise when local journalists only discover it three or four days later.
If you’re Matt Hancock, you “throw a sickie”. You’ve had enough punishment beatings in the House of Commons to last several ministerial careers and you’ve no intention of showing up for another. So it was left to the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, to answer an urgent question from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, about the new guidance for eight areas of the country. Fair to say, that’s an hour of Zahawi’s life that will have left him feeling more than a little under the weather.

                    <span>The government’s free-market doctrine will damage rural communities, writes Richard Harvey. Plus letters from Peter Smith, Dr John Lingard, Julia Edwards and Gary Nethercott
How ironic that the EU is currently introducing sweeping reforms of its farming subsidies to halt the decline of small farms, so as to retain the benefits of thriving rural communities, management of the landscape and the production of quality local food (Fewer, bigger, more intensive: EU vows to stem drastic loss of small farms, 24 May).
At the same time, small UK farmers are facing an increasingly difficult future (Prince Charles: small-scale family farms must be at heart of sustainable future, 24 May). The UK government, driven by free-market doctrine, is aiming to make UK farms larger and more efficient producers of lower-quality cheap food. These objectives will be achieved by opening our markets to the competition created by unlimited quantities of tariff-free foods from Australia, Canada and the US. In addition, a scheme to pension off small farmers is now being introduced.

The case for reducing the national speed limit from 70mph to 50mph was made by Stephen Plowden and Mayer Hillman in 1996 and reinforced many times, including by the environmental audit committee in 2006. The prime reason has been reducing carbon emissions from petrol and diesel, but your article (‘If there’d been a hard shoulder, I’d still have my mum’: are smart motorways safe?, 22 May) sets out the safety case: reducing speeds on conventional motorways is saving more lives than are being lost on “all lane running” smart motorways.
The case for a lower national speed limit has become even more compelling with the need to transition to electric cars, the range of which is about 30% greater at 50mph than at 70mph.

The government has persistently refused to set out plans to reform the funding of adult social care, despite repeated promises.
In the meantime, almost nine out of 10 local authorities in England expect to make cuts in adult social care services this year, 2021-22. As the Kings Fund recently put it, while we wait for funding reforms “more families are being failed every day.”

The Labour leader, in a joint video statement with the shadow cabinet ministers David Lammy and Marsha de Cordova, said eradicating structural racism would be a “defining cause” for the next Labour government.

Wedding businesses are increasingly nervous about the future and bosses have warned the UK industry is on the brink of collapse if restrictions are not eased in June, after it was reported Boris Johnson was waiting until 2022 to get married.
On Sunday, the Sun reported that the prime minister and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, are waiting until July 2022 to get married to be on the safe side, even though current restrictions in England on weddings, which limit attendees to 30 people, are due to be relaxed on 21 June.

England’s five-Test series against India is expected to proceed as planned with a revised plan to squeeze the second half of the Indian Premier League between the tour’s conclusion and the T20 World Cup in October.
The IPL’s Covid-related suspension on 4 May left 31 matches remaining and faced with a £200m loss should these go unplayed the Board of Control for Cricket in India has been seeking to carve out a new window in September.

Potential for bad weather remains in mountain stages

Were Egan Bernal riding for any other team but Sir Dave Brailsford’s Ineos Grenadiers, the talk now would be whether he will start the Tour de France on 27 June, assuming – as seems highly likely – that on Sunday he wins the Giro d’Italia, a race that he and his colleagues have had a total stranglehold since day nine.
There is no arguing with the Colombian’s lead on Tuesday’s rest day of 2min 24sec over home hope Damiano Caruso and 3min 40sec over the Briton Hugh Carthy, just as there has been no getting around the collective strength of Ineos, marshalled by the world time-trial champion Filippo Ganna since the start in Turin on 8 May. Bernal’s victory is not guaranteed, but it looks inevitable.

What comes to mind when she thinks of the Yugoslav wars? “I think of words like Milošević, Serbo-Croatia, Bosnia … I think there’s a star on the flag?” she flounders. “I remember there was a Time magazine cover with a man at the end of the war.”
Frances-White is in the hot seat because she is a guest on Conflict of Interest, a new podcast from the Imperial War Museums (IWM) – the Spitfire above her head is hung from the ceiling of its London museum’s atrium, and her interrogator is Carl Warner, the IWM’s head of narrative and curatorial.

With 365 Conservative MPs in the Commons, it’s understandable that some of them, especially those who are relatively new to Westminster, are looking for something to help them stand out from the crowd.
In the Theresa May years it was easy: declare yourself a member of the European Research Group (ERG) and you’d be whisked to a television studio before you could say “chuck Chequers” or “bin the backstop”. But after Boris Johnson won an 80-seat majority to get Brexit done, things have got a bit harder.

In what was described as a “landmark victory” by Liberty, one of the applicants, the judges also found the bulk interception regime breached the right to freedom of expression and contained insufficient protections for confidential journalistic material but said the decision to operate a bulk interception regime did not of itself violate the European convention on human rights.

                    <span>Was getting into bed with the streaming giant a huge mistake for the most prolific man in TV? It seems so: his new shows are anaemic, disposable – and will leave you feeling queasy
Bow down, bow down before the towering chutzpah of Ryan Murphy – who in just four years has made Feud, Hollywood, The Prom, The Boys in the Band, Ratched, two seasons of The Politician, three apiece of American Crime Story and Pose, and four of American Horror Story – for making a show about a talented gay man whose mistake was to spread himself thin.
Yes, Murphy has made his TV show again – this time about the fashion designer Halston (played by Ewan McGregor), whose clothes were everywhere in the 70s and who was himself in with the Studio 54 crowd. Eventually, he fatally diluted his brand by trying to be everything to everyone, signing a deal with JC Penney to mass-market his designs, which put paid to his high-end business. 
Just as JC Penney was a bad fit for Halston, Netflix is in many ways a bad fit for Murphy. In seeking to provide content for the platform – as part of a $300m (£210m) megadeal – Murphy has plundered recent history and gay culture for inspiration. The result is a series of shows that are superficially outre, but somehow defanged, like Halloween costumes designed for kids.

French and German YouTubers, bloggers and influencers have been offered money by a supposedly UK-based PR agency with apparent Russian connections to falsely tell their followers the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is responsible for hundreds of deaths.
Fazze, which said it was an “influencer marketing platform … connecting bloggers and advertisers”, claimed to be based at 5 Percy Street in London but is not registered there. On Tuesday, it closed its website and made its Instagram account private.

                    <span>Despite mawkishly worrying about my parents, I have always been comforted by easy travel to get home from London to Ireland. Now I can’t help but dwell on what I’m missing

I sometimes think about the fact that I’m pretty sure I don’t want children and wonder where the roots of my disinclination lie. I still have the ingrained pregnancy terror of the Catholic girls’ school, 14 years after I left it, and I’ve rarely felt financially stable enough to bring a whole new hungry mouth into the equation. But what you could kindly call my ambivalence about motherhood – or more accurately term repulsion – is really down to what I am like as a daughter. It isn’t that I was the most nightmarish disaster kid imaginable – though I was at times – but that I’ve always been such a morbid, mawkish child.
I’ve fixated on my parents’ eventual deaths since they were still more or less kids themselves, vibrant and good-looking and in their 30s. When I was 15, my dad tried to talk me out of a hysterical spiral I’d worked myself into, and when he asked what was wrong I cried: “You’re going to die!” like some two-bit soothsayer. Children already act as horrid little portals into the abyss of mortality, flourishing while their parents decline, so it seems especially excessive that I insisted on spelling this out so often.

The fire risk assessor hired to check the safety of Grenfell Tower put letters after his name suggesting professional registrations that either did not exist or which he did not have, the inquiry into the disaster has heard.
Carl Stokes, a former firefighter who was recruited by the Grenfell landlord, used six “post-nominals” when he was bidding for the job but agreed under cross-examination at the inquiry into the disaster that they had either “come out of [his] own head because they didn’t exist or were thoroughly misleading truncations” of courses he had undertaken.

Perhaps not right at the top of the list of the things that most people remember about 2020 is the fact that it was the 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth. But on the afternoon of Sunday 16 March 2020, I was in my seat in the Royal Festival Hall for a mammoth Beethoven birthday concert. Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra were re-enacting Beethoven’s famous 1808 marathon performance. Unlike the 1808 concert, by all accounts a chaotic affair in a freezing cold theatre with an under-rehearsed orchestra, Salonen’s performance was brilliantly polished and the heating was on in the RFH. But the concert was haunted by a sense that the world was about to change. In the words of one critic, it had an end-of-days feel.
Covid-19 was stalking the world and we were hearing of cancelled concerts and festivals in Beijing, in New York, in Helsinki. The Philharmonia’s concert was a sell-out at the box office, but the hall had a gap-toothed appearance – a significant number of people had decided to play it safe and stay at home. Stephen Fry, who was narrating the concert, thanked those who had come for being there and predicted that this could be “the last mass gathering we see for a while”. That turned out to be a major understatement. Afterwards, backstage – usually the site of much professional hugging – I had my first experience of the elbow bump.

A report published on Tuesday by parliament’s independent expert panel (IEP), found Roberts made repeated and unwanted sexual advances towards a former member of staff, as well as inappropriate comments of a sexual nature.

Katie, Highlands
“I was never a big aubergine fan,” sympathises Neil Campbell, head chef at Rovi in London. “The skin was always an issue for me: it’s bitter and astringent, but looks lush and shiny, and it tricked me every time.” While salvation can be found in the likes of Meera Sodha’s walnut-stuffed aubergines, Campbell finally saw the light when he started working for “the master of all aubergine dishes”, Yotam Ottolenghi. “I’m now fully converted.”

What a pleasure to hear once again from Dominic Cummings, the Conservative government’s Prince Harry, who on Wednesday appears in exile to kick off his searing new select committee series, The Me You Didn’t See.
In recent days, Dom has already been speaking his truth at vast and seemingly interminable length on a Twitter thread in which his inner turmoil is laid bare time and again. Hugely poignant now to look back on the brave face he wore during events of last year and to know that inside he was actually falling – falling apart. Attempts to reach out to people who ran the government, such as himself, seem to have met with total neglect. You can see why ultimately he had to do what any man would do, and move his family to a place of safety: hurtling in a car towards Barnard Castle, wondering if the black circles are sharper on the red background or the green background.

                    <span>As his explicit, hilarious Netflix sitcom Special returns, Ryan O’Connell talks about why Hollywood refuses to consider disabled people – and why he’s made his show ‘gayer and gimpier’ 
The frank, fizzy comedy Special, which has just landed on Netflix, is a tale of two Ryans. There is Ryan Hayes, the main character, a gay intern with cerebral palsy who lives in Los Angeles with his mollycoddling mother. Then there is Ryan O’Connell, the show’s star and creator, who is also a gay Angelino with cerebral palsy. But there the similarities end. Moments from O’Connell’s life resurface on screen, such as the time he was hit by a car then pretended to his new college friends that his limp was a result of the accident. (Season one ends with Ryan coming out as disabled.) But whereas Ryan is gauche and apologetic, his 34-year-old creator is almost intimidatingly sassy and self-possessed.
Talking over Zoom from his home, O’Connell speaks at the speed, and in the style, of Twitter. Anyone who read the tell-all blogs he wrote in his 20s, or his memoir I’m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves (from which Special is adapted), will recognise the exuberant voice. Song lyrics and invisible exclamation marks litter his conversation, while acronyms and punctuation are verbalised: “LOL”, “Dot-dot-dot.” He’s like the internet personified, but with none of the spite.

                    <span>Find out who is leading the polling to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor of Germany
Germans will vote on Sunday 26 September to elect a new Bundestag, or federal parliament. The result – after coalition negotiations likely to involve two or three parties – will decide who will succeed Angela Merkel, who is standing down after 16 years as chancellor.
Some recent polls have put Germany’s Green party in the lead, as Merkel’s successor at the conservative CDU, Armin Laschet, struggles to inherit her appeal. German federal elections are proportional, so the share of vote given by polling companies should be read as translating fairly directly into share of seats in the resulting parliament. Only parties with less than 5% of the national vote, or less than three directly elected constituency seats, are not awarded proportional parliamentary seats.

Poland’s government has defied an injunction by the top European Union court that ordered the immediate closure of a major brown coalmine, with officials saying it would shake the nation’s energy system and lead to the loss of thousands of jobs.
The country’s development minister, Jarosław Gowin, said Poland would not shut the lignite mine in Turów, on the border with Germany and the Czech Republic, but instead was engaged in “very intensive diplomatic and law-related efforts” to secure undisturbed operation of the mine and connected power plant that generates 7% of Poland‘s energy.

Vigils are to be held across the UK to mark the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 25 May last year after a white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
His death sparked global outcry and was the catalyst for widespread anti-racist protests across the world last summer. Thousands marched in towns and cities in the UK under the banner of Black Lives Matter while others, unable to take part in person due to the pandemic, joined in via social media.

The gloopy, mucus-like substance had not been recorded in Turkish waters before 2007. It is created as a result of prolonged warm temperatures and calm weather and in areas with abundant nutrients in the water.

Hong Kong could soon be throwing away Covid-19 vaccine doses because not enough people are taking them before they expire, a health official has warned, saying it’s “not right” while other countries are scrambling for them.
The city of 7.5 million people has bought enough doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and China’s Sinovac, to vaccinate its entire population, but so far only 2.1 million have been administered since the vaccination programme launched in late February.

                    <span>The killing a year ago sparked a justified, constructive anger at racial injustice that is still felt around the world
It was all supposed to blow over in a few days. Thomas Jefferson once said of Black Americans that “their griefs are transient”. These were people who lived life with a more muted emotional palette than everybody else. As their pain was fickle and their depths of feeling shallow, their lives were more expendable than others’. An unemployed Black American in his mid-40s with a criminal record, George Floyd’s life wasn’t supposed to add up to much, especially in our age of mass distraction. Perhaps his name would trend on Twitter for a while. Perhaps there would be a handful of marches. But inevitably, we would soon all move on to more important matters. We always do.
After all, it is difficult to imagine a more mundane police encounter than the one facing the officers who confronted Floyd for apparently buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill a year ago. This is not a scenario that should produce a world-changing event. And it wouldn’t have done, had things unfolded a little differently. With last month’s conviction of Derek Chauvin leading commentators to argue that, in the end, the system does work, it is worth remembering the direction that this case was taking before it sparked a global movement.

Since its reboot in 2019, the Face magazine has featured Jorja Smith, Tyler, the Creator and Dua Lipa on the cover. The June issue out this week, is – in the spirit of reemergence – less about solos and more about the collective. Or, indeed, the team. It is Euro 202o ready. The cover features Chelsea’s Mason Mount and Arsenal’s Leah Williamson, along with a cast of 22 other characters including fashion designer Martine Rose. Rose – along with Mount – is wearing the England supporter’s shirt she has designed in collaboration with Nike.
While Rose is not a household name, she has the reputation within the right circles that means fashionable football fans are likely to buy this shirt when it is released in July. Rose’s clothes have been worn by Rihanna and A$AP Rocky, and Drake starred in her video presentation, What We Do All Day, released in January.

The study, published by environmental campaign groups Greenpeace and WWF, shows the City provided loans and investments for projects and companies that emitted 805m tonnes of CO2 in 2019. That is 1.8 times the UK’s own annual net emissions for the same year, which totalled 455m tonnes when discounting aviation and shipping, sectors that the UK government also does not include in its emissions calculations.

                    <span>His case over PPE contracts has got under ministers’ skin – and he says he has ambitions beyond litigation
As the Good Law Project’s latest legal challenge to the government draws to a close this week, its founder, Jolyon Maugham, has revealed the extent to which the case has got under ministers’ skin.
The judicial review over contracts for personal protective equipment awarded without competition concludes on Tuesday, almost two months to the day since the barrister received a letter from the government’s lawyers. “I was asked by the government legal department to refer myself to my professional regulator, the Bar Standards Board,” the QC tells the Guardian. Maugham says he refused and invited the government to refer him itself, as he says many others he has irked have done.

                    <span>During the second world war, Chinese merchant seamen helped keep Britain fed, fuelled and safe – and many gave their lives doing so. But from late 1945, hundreds of them who had settled in Liverpool suddenly disappeared. Now their children are piecing together the truth
On 19 October 1945, 13 men gathered in Whitehall for a secret meeting. It was chaired by Courtenay Denis Carew Robinson, a senior Home Office official, and he was joined by representatives of the Foreign Office, the Ministry of War Transport, and the Liverpool police and immigration inspectorate. After the meeting, the Home Office’s aliens department opened a new file, designated HO/213/926. Its contents were not to be discussed in the House of Commons or the Lords, or with the press, or acknowledged to the public. It was titled “Compulsory repatriation of undesirable Chinese seamen”.
As the vast process of post-second world war reconstruction creaked into action, this deportation programme was, for the Home Office and Clement Attlee’s new government, just one tiny component. The country was devastated – hundreds of thousands were dead, millions were homeless, unemployment and inflation were soaring. The cost of the war had been so great that the UK would not finish paying back its debt to the US until 2006. Amid the bombsites left by the Luftwaffe, poverty, desperation and resentment were rife. In Liverpool, the city council was desperate to free up housing for returning servicemen.

                    <span>For some, living in a van is their culture or a symbol of resistance. But for many others it is the only possible response to our growing housing crisis – and proposed legislation could make life much harder for them

For Stef, living in a van made perfect sense. He was on the road all the time, travelling from music festival to music festival, feeding revellers his homemade pizzas. Soon, he had saved enough money to buy a secondhand white LDV Convoy. He moved into it in December 2019, but by early 2020, the pandemic had kicked in, lockdown was under way, and music festivals were a non-starter.
Stef didn’t have enough money to rent a place to live. “I’m on universal credit: £490 a month to live on,” he says. “Half of that goes on running and insuring the van. So there’s not a lot of wiggle room.” He may have dreamed of living in a van before, but now it was his only option.

                    <span>A year ago, the murder of George Floyd caused outrage in Minneapolis – and kicked off a protest movement that spread across the world. How do the young Black people at the heart of the story live with his legacy?
A year after George Floyd was murdered, the movement instigated by his death has spread across the US and the world, but Black people in Minneapolis are still living with the emotional fallout from that day. Anushka Asthana speaks to Amudalat Ajasa, who was still a student when she heard the news and marched in protest against police brutality against Black people before becoming a Guardian contributor earlier this year. Amudalat looks back on how the crisis has changed her sense of her city and why she felt compelled to document the movement as it took shape.
They also discuss Amudalat’s interview with Chris Martin, the 19-year-old Black man who sold George Floyd a packet of cigarettes and then watched in disbelief as he died on the sidewalk outside. He told how he wrestled with a sense of guilt over his decision to report that the $20 bill Floyd used to pay might be fake, and reflected on how the guilty verdicts after he testified at Derek Chauvin’s trial helped him understand he bore no responsibility.

The photojournalist Esther Mbabazi travelled to Bwindi national park and spent time photographing several families of the nomadic hunter-gatherers

This work is supported and produced by the Magnum Foundation, with a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation

In late March this year, Esther Mbabazi left behind Kampala, the chaotic capital of Uganda, and headed for the hills, forests, swamps and grasslands of Bwindi Impenetrable national park an eight-hour drive to the west. She went to find the communities of the Batwa people, who live on the park’s green, rainy edges.
Mbabazi, 26, had always been curious about the Batwa and wanted to find out how one of the most marginalised communities in east Africa had coped with the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent months she had been working on gruelling stories about human rights abuses following the disputed election in Uganda in January, and this new project, sponsored by the Magnum Foundation, was a welcome change.

Rachel Humphreys hears from Rose, who thought little of filling out a web form to arrange the redelivery of a pot of face cream and set off a chain of events that would wind up with a fraudster emptying her bank account. 

Rachel also speaks to Hilary Osborne, the Guardian’s money and consumer editor, who has been investigating the scale of the new wave of coronavirus scams and hearing from readers whose lives have been turned upside down – through the loss of their savings, but also a sense of shame.

Anushka Asthana talks to Hazem Balousha, a Guardian correspondent who lives in Gaza. He describes living in, and reporting from, the strip, which was under heavy bombardment from last Monday until the agreement of a ceasefire, beginning early on Friday morning. The latest conflict started after Israel attempted to evict Palestinian residents from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood in east Jerusalem and Israeli police stormed the Jerusalem compound which is home to al-Aqsa mosque after days of worsening clashes. Hamas issued an ultimatum for Israel to withdraw forces and as soon as that passed started firing rockets from Gaza into Israel. Hazem discusses the impact the bombardment has had on him, his family and other Gaza residents, and examines what would need to change for life to improve for them all.
Anushka also talks to Rashid Khalidi, a Palestinian American professor of modern Arab studies at Columbia university in New York and the author of the Hundred Years’ War on Palestine about the history of the Palestinian struggle for statehood.

The Guardian&#x27;s Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan, explains why a new Houthi offensive could heap more misery on the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire
