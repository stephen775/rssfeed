 1.16am BST 
On 14, Koepka’s second bounds into the thick stuff lining the green. His chip is weak, and he’s quickly handing back the shot he’d picked up on 13. It’s just not happening for the 2017 and 2018 champion today.
 1.14am BST 
Another birdie for Rodgers, who creams his second at 7 straight at the flag, then steers in the gentle left-to-right slider that remains from 12 feet. He’s -2. And then Henley steers in his right-to-left par saver from 15 feet on 6! That’s a huge bonus. He remains at -5, in a tie with Bland at the top.

                    <span>Gareth Southgate decided not to start Aston Villa man and that caution underpinned England’s dour display against Scotland
With four minutes to play at Wembley, with a feeling of the air shooting up out of the stadium, possibilities folding in on themselves, with the kilted men in the stands already on their feet, arms spread in a swell of fond, goalless-draw triumphalism, Jack Grealish took a pass and was followed right the way back into his own half by Stephen O’Donnell. Grealish turned and twisted and feinted, like a seahorse twirling across the coral, and eventually drew a knee to the thigh from an exasperated O’Donnell, who was booked as he sprinted back.
It is always tempting to see signs and flags. It will be tempting for England fans, Jack fans, those who identify as pro-Grealo and anti-Gareth – because these are binary times and even here we find our oppositions – to imagine that same sequence taking place an hour and a half earlier, when the game was still fluid, and England’s attacking patterns not yet congealed into something damp and soggy and unhappy.

                    <span>‘We’ve got to be better and that starts with me,’ says manager
Steve Clarke ‘proud’ of Scotland’s response to opening defeat

Gareth Southgate justified substituting Harry Kane during England’s uninspired goalless draw with Scotland by saying that removing his captain gave his team more energy up front.
England’s manager was left with concerns over Kane’s form after his side, who have four points from their first two games in Group D, walked off to jeers at Wembley on Friday night. The striker was poor again after struggling in last Sunday’s win over Croatia and Southgate, who had no complaints about the boos that greeted the full-time whistle, felt that bringing on Marcus Rashford would cause Scotland’s defence more problems.

Coronavirus – latest updates

Almost two-thirds of workers in England seeking grants to help them self-isolate are being refused help, sparking warnings from trade unions that a key policy to limit Covid-19 is “failing” in the face of rising infections.
Councils are continuing to refuse more than six out of 10 applications despite the government increasing funding for the vital anti-Covid system in March to £20m a month, freedom of information requests by the Trades Union Congress found.

Workers must be given a right to do their jobs from home, Labour has demanded as it piled pressure on the government not to let its consultation on flexible working be kicked into the long grass.
In the first major announcement made by Angela Rayner since gaining the portfolio of shadow cabinet minister for the future of work, she said employers should not be able to “dictate terms” to staff when the guidance urging people to work from home is expected to be lifted next month.

                    <span>Tom and Ben Curry have helped spark Sale’s revival and will be a handful for Exeter in their semi-final on Saturday
It sounds like a plot line straight out of a science fiction novel. Imagine if you could clone a world-class player and end up with two athletes equally as fit, strong and potentially influential as each other. Now imagine the future is already here. No wonder Sale’s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, sounds like a man who cannot quite believe his good fortune.
And why not? Exeter Chiefs tend to reserve their best for Premiership semi-finals at Sandy Park – played five, won five – but this time they will be confronted by a unique double Shark attack. Never before have the identical Curry twins, Tom and Ben, started such a high-profile domestic game in tandem; having already celebrated their 23rd birthdays with a family barbecue this week, a Twickenham final would be the ideal shared present.

                    <span>England had the points on the board, they had the star quality and the theory was that they would drive home their favouritism, making a statement en route to the last 16 of this European Championship. So much for theories. Instead, it turned into a night of frustration, when the flaws in Gareth Southgate’s attacking gameplan were etched across Wembley and Scotland revelled in showing their old rivals that it is a perilous business to write them off.
On an occasion that will live long in the memories of the few thousand visiting fans in attendance, who included Sir Alex Ferguson, their team defied England, holding them at arm’s length with a performance of spirit and no little quality. From an England point of view, it was disconcerting to witness the relative ease with which they did so.

The protracted search for a permanent successor to José Mourinho took its latest turn when Gattuso was ruled out. He left Fiorentina on Thursday after a disagreement over transfer policy, having been in charge there for just over three weeks, and entered discussions with Spurs.

                    <span>Pursuit of ‘normal birth’ has sometimes compromised the safety of mothers and babies, with consequences for maternity care
When I was a medical student and junior doctor, the terms most commonly used to describe a vaginal birth without the use of instruments such as forceps or vacuum extractor were SVB (spontaneous vaginal birth) or SVD (spontaneous vertex delivery – the vertex is the top of the baby’s head).
Gradually, in the late 1980s and 1990s, there appeared in the lexicon the words “normal birth”. This was part of the reaction against the perceived high rates of interventions in pregnancy and labour, and the desire of women to take more control over their own bodies, something I support.

It is the story of a global superpower, a smuggling operation, pestilence and a small hairy fruit.
Ubiquitous on supermarket shelves and in lunchboxes, the humble kiwi is New Zealand’s most valuable horticultural export. Recent battles for control of the fruit, however, have shone a light on tensions in New Zealand’s relationship with China.

Moshing is surely the final stage of the journey back to normality in a post-lockdown world. Hundreds of sweaty people slamming into each other with full bodily contact might not appeal to everyone, but it is impossible not to appreciate how monumental a step it is after more than a year of being told to stay 2 metres apart.
“After being distanced for so long, it’s going to be weird. But I’m going to be straight in there. You’ve got to throw yourself in at the deep end,” said Shay Fagan, 22, one of 10,000 rock and heavy metal fans arriving at Download Pilot festival on Friday eager to return to the mosh pit.

Mike Pence, the former US vice-president, has been heckled as a “traitor” for his refusal to overturn last year’s election result during a speech to a gathering of religious conservatives.
Pence, who is widely seen as laying the groundwork for a White House run in 2024, had entered an auditorium in Orlando, Florida to a standing ovation on Friday. But a small group began shouted abuse including “traitor!” as he began a 28-minute speech. The dissenters were quickly escorted out by police.

                    <span>Hampstead theatre, London
Deborah Bruce’s play about the awkward reunion of two fortysomething ex-lovers contains some individually striking observations but too much contrivance
Alex (Claire Price) and Jason (Bo Poraj) are stumbling around in the dark after a fairly drunken and faintly depressing university reunion. They were lovers as students and now, back in the house where they first hooked up, they’re looking to rekindle things. Only they can’t find a light. “Is there meant to be electricity?” asks Alex. It’s a line that is supposed to shimmer with subtext but feels heavy handed in a play about lost love, lost youth and lost people that fails to flare into life.
Deborah Bruce’s previous play at Hampstead theatre, Godchild, was about a fortysomething woman struggling to let go of her youth. In Raya, the female protagonist, Alex, is a few years older and in the grips of menopause. Price performs with a fragile intensity and Alex’s monologues contain a few striking observations (“I can’t be at home – I’m drab in all my mirrors”). But the vast majority of the play does not feel this focused or truthful. The plot twists, when they eventually come, land with a thud. Price and Poraj have a nice spiky chemistry but the erratic script often works against them. There’s an extraordinarily hard-working bottle of wine, which is used with alarming regularity to keep the play moving, and the characters are given increasingly random reasons to drink, stay on stage and keep talking.

Companies with high greenhouse gas emissions should be subject to a carbon price of $75 a tonne of carbon dioxide, the International Monetary Fund has said, as a way of reaching the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
A carbon floor price would mean that companies, including energy generators and heavy industries, would have to pay for the carbon they produce. At present, many countries and regions have their own carbon pricing systems, but there is no globally agreed carbon price.

The loss comes after a year in which Starbucks was forced by the pandemic to temporarily close all of its 935 UK shops, leading to a steep fall in revenues.

“I’ve not played a Test match for a while, so it was just about getting back into it,” Ecclestone said at the close. “It’s a weird situation that I’m not used to. It helped this morning getting that first wicket with my first ball, made me a bit more relaxed.

Senior Conservatives have warned Boris Johnson a swathe of seats in the “blue wall” across the south of England could be at risk, as his party was gripped by recriminations in the aftermath of the Liberal Democrats’ shock victory in the Chesham and Amersham byelection.
Downing Street came under renewed pressure to ditch Johnson’s controversial planning reforms, which many backbenchers blamed for the humiliating loss of the Buckinghamshire seat.

Given the new bout of soul searching for which Germany are bracing themselves, a good omen never did anyone much harm. They have never lost against a Portugal side containing Cristiano Ronaldo and in fact it gets even better: the record reads played four, won four, with an aggregate in their favour of 11 goals to three.
That tally suggests a freewheeling spirit Joachim Löw could do with rekindling when they meet again, for the first time in seven years, on Saturday. A win is not essential to their advancement in Euro 2020: the fact they finish their Group F campaign against a workaday Hungary sees to that. But Germany need to show they can topple another of the tournament’s front runners, preferably with a display of ambition and brio. Much less, and question marks will continue to hover well into next week.

                    <span>Clearly the death of Liberal England has been prematurely foretold, but more will be needed to turn a stunning byelection win into a successful revival

It is often hard to try to derive a national message from a single byelection. The effect on party morale usually dwarfs that felt on government policy. The election of Liberal Democrat Sarah Green as the MP for Chesham and Amersham, a commuter-belt seat north-west of London, stuns on both counts. The result will make Conservative MPs in relatively liberal and educated constituencies very jumpy. But it will also slow the progress of Boris Johnson’s planning reforms. Voters in bucolic Buckinghamshire plainly feared that these would make it easier for developers to concrete over the countryside.
What the result shows is that the Liberal Democrat cause is not a hopeless one. With just 11 parliamentarians and languishing at 7% in national polls, Sir Ed Davey appeared to be taking his depleted ranks and marching them towards the sound of gunfire. Chesham and Amersham has been held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1974. Yet Ms Green overturned a 16,000-strong Tory majority to take the seat by just over 8,000 votes, a swing of 25%, and upset the odds. The energy of the Tories’ vaccine bounce seems dissipated. Clearly the death of Liberal England has been prematurely foretold.

                    <span>The collapse in rape prosecutions has created a climate of impunity. Women are right to be furious 
The pledges made by ministers in their keenly awaited rape review must lead to immediate and tightly focused action, enabled by sufficient funding. The current picture with regard to the criminal justice system’s handling of rape is a disaster, of which ministers have rightly said that they are ashamed. Of 52,210 rapes recorded in 2020, just 843 resulted in a charge or a summons. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and a victim of a sexual offence herself, sums up the situation accurately in saying that rape victims are “nearly always” failed.
Some of the reasons for this are, as the review recognises, complex. These include a chronic failure to reckon with the digital environment and the vast information trails it creates. Others are pretty straightforward, notably the destructive impact of austerity. Prosecuting rape and other sexual offences is acknowledged by all to be difficult. The disbanding of specialist teams in police forces had predictably harmful effects. Chaos in the courts system leading to delays, and a lack of victim support, have also contributed to a collapse in confidence: the proportion of complainants dropping out of cases rose from 25% to 43% in five years.

Its director, David Lynch, had the first stab at designing workable prosthetics. “But when I tried a piece of it on John Hurt,” Lynch recalled, “he couldn’t move and he said, ‘A valiant effort, David’.” Lynch was plunged into despair, certain that his film would be a disaster, until the British makeup artist Christopher Tucker came to the rescue. But applying the resulting designs, which had been modelled from a cast of the real Joseph Merrick, whose story the movie told, fell upon the makeup artist Walter Schneiderman.
Schneiderman, who has died aged 98, called the film “one of the hardest pictures I had to do”. It took seven hours each day to put the makeup on Hurt, and another two to take it off again. “Everything was so precise,” he said. “There were 14 pieces, not including the head, and they had to be applied exactly, every day for continuity. You couldn’t afford to make a mistake.” Schneiderman was acclaimed for his work on the movie, which was nominated for eight Oscars. The lack of official recognition for Tucker and Schneiderman caused a furore, which led to the implementation the following year of a new Oscar category for best makeup.

                    <span>Michael Steadman, Michael Bulley, Robert Vanderplank and Peter Millen on the difficulties facing British residents abroad, EU citizens in the UK, and employers in Britain
Your article highlighting the post-Brexit problems faced by British residents in France has a major omission (British nationals in France face losing rights if they miss residency deadline, 15 June). It is likely that a considerable number, between 3,000 and 6,000, stand to lose the right to drive as of the end of this year. This is because Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement made no provision for an exchange of licences between our two countries. The only option for these Brits, many of them elderly and in rural areas, will be compulsory driving tuition followed by a written and practical test – all in French, of course. Happily, this is not the outcome for citizens of over 150 other countries, including South Korea and Botswana, who have long since negotiated exchange agreements with France.

• You have highlighted the difficulties that UK nationals living in France may face if they have not yet applied for post-Brexit residential status. In some areas, French public administration has a well-deserved reputation for obtuseness, but I have just received my residency card and I can attest to the sympathetic and helpful way the authorities have acted. It is as if they are embarrassed at having to make Britons, particularly ones who have lived in France for a long time, jump through these silly hoops. I certainly found it odd having to ask for permission to live in my own house.

Christian Eriksen has been discharged from hospital after a successful operation to fit a defibrillator implant. The Denmark midfielder had to be resuscitated on the pitch at Parken in Copenhagen after having a cardiac arrest during the first half of his side’s 1-0 Euro 2020 Group B defeat to Finland on Saturday evening.
The 29-year-old Internazionale player is returning home after having an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted and has visited his Denmark teammates.

                    <span>Prof Jonathan Parker says the government needs to gain people’s trust, especially those working at the sharp end of social care, while Dr Dorothea Morfey offers clarity over hepatitis B vaccinations for medical staff
I am passionate about the importance of the Covid-19 vaccination programme. I recently wrote a paper in the Journal of Adult Protection identifying the structural abuse of people in care homes during the Covid pandemic, which implicated the government by means of its approach in the initial and subsequent wave. So, it may be assumed that I would be supportive of moves to mandate the vaccination of care home staff who work specifically with older people (Report, 15 June).
This seems to me, however, like a distraction, a passing of blame by government to those staff who, for whatever reasons, are anxious about having the vaccine, rather than government ministers owning their inadequate and structurally discriminatory response in the first place. The government needs to gain the trust of the people, especially those working at the sharp end of social care, through honesty, openness and acceptance of fault in order to encourage everyone to take up the necessary vaccinations to halt the spread of this virus.

Could it be that what the Brexit gods giveth with one hand, they taketh away with the other?

All is grey today at Cody Dock. The Lea – London’s second river, which snakes its way through the east of the city – is a greenish grey. Its banks are a muddy grey. The vast sky is a cotton wool grey. And the high-rises on the distant horizon are a bluey grey.
So the reds, yellows, oranges and greens that arch across the Lea feel like a sign of hope – a splash of colour against that samey palette. Hope is very much what the artist responsible for this burst of colour represents, although it’s fair to say she would have been stunned to see her drawing translated into vinyl and stretched across 60 metres (200ft) of bridge, six decades after her death.

The EU has failed in a legal attempt to secure an urgent 120m vaccine doses from AstraZeneca by the end of this month, while securing a judgment that sites in Oxford and Staffordshire should have been used in the past to make good on deliveries.
The court of first instance in Brussels ordered the Anglo-Swedish company to deliver just 10m more than it has already provided by the end of September, and make “best efforts”, including potentially the use of UK facilities, to provide the further 220m jabs to which it is contractually committed.

The University of Liverpool and University of Leicester have been hit by strikes by staff protesting against redundancies, with lecturers refusing to mark assessments, leading some departments at Leicester to consider using algorithms to fill gaps in marking. Liverpool has proposed delaying final results until the next academic year in October.

                    <span>Sacha Dench to fly anticlockwise around coast of British mainland, starting and finishing near Glasgow
A woman dubbed “the human swan” has said she is feeling excited as she prepares to launch a world-first circumnavigation of mainland Britain in a paraglider powered with an electric engine, to raise awareness about climate change.
Sacha Dench is making the 3,000-mile journey to mark the Cop26 UN climate change conference taking place in Glasgow later this year.

                    <span>This year, hay fever season is unbelievably bad, everyone has it – and none of the suggested remedies are any help to my teenage son
My 13-year-old son hates autumn, winter and early spring – anything that isn’t shorts weather – and he keeps up a constant drumbeat of how insufficient the British climate is to his sunshine needs and all the places he’ll be more likely to live when he’s older, such as California. Then, for about two hours at the start of June, he’s happy. And then he gets hay fever. It was years before I really believed in it. I thought it was like when people say they have an allergy when really they are on a diet. I definitely remember, when I was a kid, that it was just something you said for an extra 15 minutes on your exam times.
More years passed before it entered my parental toolkit, and I could reliably put my hands on a packet of antihistamines every day. My learning curve veered sharply upwards the year I had to take him to A&amp;E because he couldn’t breathe, and that was hay fever – particularly since, on the same day, my daughter had broken her foot and I thought it was a sprain. So I was back in A&amp;E a day later, having to explain why hay fever was higher up my list of emergencies than broken bones. Trampolines and pollen shot up my risk register over this period.

A Utah junior high school that took two official photos of its cheerleading squad did not include the 14-year-old team member with Down syndrome in one of these pictures – and chose to use that image in its yearbook and on social media, according to reports.
Shoreline junior high school cheer squad member Morgyn Arnold had been the team’s manager, and “knew all the routines by heart”, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. In the photo that included Arnold, she was seated in the front row, whereas in the second image she was clearly absent.

From holding your breath to having a friend shout “boo!”, there is no shortage of alleged cures for hiccups. Now scientists say they have found a better solution: a drinking straw device.
When you get hiccups – or singultus as they are known in medicine – the diaphragm and intercostal muscles suddenly contract. The subsequent abrupt intake of air causes the opening between the vocal folds – known as the glottis – to shut, resulting in a “hic” sound, often to the embarrassment of the afflicted and the amusement of others.

This is the “ticks-all-boxes” lower-body exercise you never knew you needed. Not only will it strengthen your legs and bum, and generate better mobility (and flexibility) in the hips and ankles, it will also improve your stability. You do one leg at a time, which works each side of your body in turn, and helps with balance. Try not to wobble: staying still works your core.

The case was also Switzerland’s first war crimes trial in a civilian court. It involved the 46-year-old Alieu Kosiah, who went by the nom de guerre “bluff boy” in the rebel faction Ulimo that fought former President Charles Taylor’s army in the 1990s.

The socially distanced places are set, the guests will soon arrive. Everything is ready for the EU’s most ambitious attempt to debate with citizens. Everything, except most of the citizens who are meant to be involved.
The Conference on the Future of Europe, an 11-month consultation whose centrepiece will be citizens’ assemblies across the EU, holds its first working session at the European parliament in Strasbourg on Saturday. While a full complement of EU politicians and officials are expected in the Rhine city, about only 27 citizens are likely to take part – a quarter of the total who would usually participate in such meetings, according to the conference website.

The total number of cases of the Covid Delta variant in the UK has risen to 75,953 to date, data has revealed, with the variant accounting for 99% of Covid cases.
On Friday 10,476 Covid cases and 11 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK – the former a slight decline compared with the 11,007 new cases reported the day before.

How are you enjoying Dominic Cummings’ mission to dump on Matt Hancock from the greatest possible height? I am beginning to think of it as Operation Moonshit. This week Cummings opted to release a series of WhatsApp messages dating back to the first wave of Covid last year, in which Boris Johnson referred to his secretary of state for health as both “hopeless” and “totally fucking hopeless”. Which at least suggests range.

As if the Wokingham Handicap were not challenging enough, the rain which changed the Ascot going from good-to-firm to borderline heavy in a matter of hours is a further complication when weighing up the biggest betting race of the Royal meeting’s final day.
King’s Lynn, in the Queen’s colours, is a slightly unexpected runner too, having finished seventh, on much quicker ground, in Tuesday’s King’s Stand Stakes. Whether he can run up to that form on this much softer going remains to be seen but 9-2 is no sort of price with so many strong alternatives available.

My partner and I are getting married this summer. It is a small wedding, and I have invited my mum and siblings. However, most of my family members are not supportive of my relationship, probably because we are both women. I didn’t expect coming out to be easy or welcomed, but I never imagined that the fallout would last this long. My mum has consistently treated my sexuality as a problem and has often been very cold towards my partner.
When I told my family that we were engaged, my mum and one sibling reacted with, at best, resignation (my other sibling was more supportive). Despite all this, I wanted to invite my closest family to our wedding. However, I’m no longer sure if this was the right decision. At no point have my mum and siblings offered congratulations or expressed positive feelings about it.

Headteacher Ben Davis bowed to the inevitable this week and wrote to all of his year-11 pupils and their families to inform them that the school prom – the now-fashionable highlight at the end of secondary school – had been postponed.
The hotel that was to have hosted the event contacted the school to say that in the light of the prime minister’s announcement on Monday that final Covid restrictions were to remain in place for another month, the prom could sadly no longer go ahead.

The chafing doesn’t bear thinking about. A replica linen condom secured with a dainty blue ribbon is one of the more wince-inducing props for a new exploration of the history of sex and intimate lives in Scotland.
The other material used to fashion prophylactics in the 17th century was animal gut, which was dried then rehydrated at the crucial moment. The Edinburgh-born diarist James Boswell writes about dipping one in a river before intercourse. He was adamant about their use to ward off venereal disease, but still recorded numerous painful bouts of infection in his journals.

                    <span>The shock result in Chesham and Amersham isn’t just about HS2. Deeper shifts are occurring that ought to worry the Tories
Four days ago, a former insider at a London-based thinktank wrote a piece for the Spectator about the forthcoming Chesham and Amersham byelection, and his sense that this little-remarked political episode would soon be over, with the minimum of fuss. “Hopefully then we can stop hearing any rubbish about how the Lib Dems are set to tear down the Conservatives’ ‘blue wall’ in the home counties,” he wrote. “As the campaign has demonstrated, the Lib Dems are miles away from being able to cause such an upset.” He ended with a prediction he evidently felt was beyond question: “The Lib Dems will lose on Thursday, most likely fairly badly, and they will have no one to blame but themselves.”
Election predictions are often a mug’s game, not least in a political climate as febrile and strange as ours is currently. But while the media largely stayed away, the Liberal Democrats’ unexpected success in suburban Buckinghamshire – where their vote jumped by 30 percentage points, while the Tories’ dropped by 20 – went with the grain of a slowly emerging shift that some of us have been following for the past three or four years, which is much cultural as political.

As Tokyo hopefuls debate the marginal gains afforded by Vaporfly running shoes, Britain’s sportswomen have been keeping another secret weapon close to their chests.
In the drive for marginal performance gains, female members of Team GB and Paralympics GB have been fitted with specially designed sports bras, to hoist, sculpt and support their path to victory.

                    <span>This month, How to Eat is digging into the chocolate spread. Is it best on croissants, pancakes or ice-cream? Why does it bang with bananas? And could the connoisseurs’ serve be straight from the jar?
The subject of heists in Germany and chaos in French supermarkets, blessed by the high priests of the kitchen pass (Nigella, Yotam) but also slathered on chips in Aberdeen, Nutella’s popularity knows no bounds.
It is less a hazelnut chocolate spread (other brands are available but, honestly, have you ever tried them?) than a global phenomenon. One that has turned its Italian parent company, Ferrero, into a circa €12bn-a-year business, created a secondary market in jar locks and resonates in the news cycle in endlessly unexpected ways: from the pre-match snacking of Brentford FC midfield “machine” Vitaly Janelt to (and, no, the date on this is not 1 April) plans to sterilise Britain’s grey squirrel population.

It is Father’s Day on Sunday. And while the traditional way to spend Father’s Day is to think about your own father, and all the sacrifices he made to raise you, let’s do things a bit differently this year. Let’s all imagine that we have better, more famous dads.
No, we should. Sony Pictures has just suggested we do exactly that, and released a study revealing that almost one in 10 of us wish that Tom Hanks would play our dad in a film. And that makes sense, more or less, because Hanks exudes a steady paternalism in most of his films. He played a father surrogate in News of the World, and Woody from Toy Story is one of the all-time great non-dad dads in cinema. Even in something as morally soupy as Road to Perdition, you could chop Hanks’s character in half and see the words “Great Dad” running through him like a stick of rock.

Gary Numan, Mogwai, Maxïmo Park, the Coral, Sports Team, Shame. Not the lineup to a cancelled two-day festival in Kidderminster, but acts who used D2C marketing to land high-charting albums. This ugly acronym stands for direct-to-consumer, and means pushing sales of physical records – often limited-edition – via their official stores and those of indie retailers. Their maxim, to quote Dua Lipa via Olivia Newton-John, is: let’s get physical.

                    <span>When the time comes, the wardrobe crisis will be back with a vengeance
I can’t wait to have a wardrobe crisis. I miss them. The heap of discarded clothes grows as the clock ticks down. My heart rate rises like I’m Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible. I’m trying to figure out which dress goes with which shoes rather than defuse a bomb, but still. The stakes feel pretty high. And never more so than now.
When the time for “going out-out” comes – which, as I’m writing this, has been pushed back a few weeks – the wardrobe crisis will be back with a vengeance. Getting dressed to go out is a completely different ballgame from just getting dressed. So many things to think about. What are my friends wearing? When they said it would be fun to get dressed up, did they mean, like, jeans and a nice top, or floor-length and a blow-dry? Is it weird to dress to celebrate the end of something that isn’t over for everyone? Why do fancy clothes so rarely have sleeves? What happens if it rains or gets cold? If someone can invent driverless cars, why are strapless bras still so uncomfortable?

                    <span>From the Amazon to the Caribbean coast, several weeks of protests have swept Colombia – dozens have died as demonstrators have faced sometimes deadly retaliation from police. 
The catalyst was a proposed tax hike, since withdrawn, in response to the coronavirus crisis. Demands expanded to calls to end inequality, economic disparity and police violence in Colombia – in almost two months, demonstrations have caused food and goods shortages.
Protest leaders have temporarily suspended in-person demonstrations due to a rise in Covid cases, but Joe Parkin Daniels, reporting for the Guardian, explains why this widespread discontent is unlikely to end

                    <span>In recent years, along with other journalists, I have been targeted by members of the far right. Yet we’re failing to address dangerous radicalisation

As soon as Nicholas Watt, the BBC Newsnight political editor, was identified by anti-lockdown protesters who had assembled in Westminster on Monday afternoon, he was chased and subjected to howling verbal abuse. As Watt ran, probably concerned about his safety, nearby police officers stood back, perhaps too busy enjoying the Mediterranean weather.
Watt’s treatment provoked justified outrage among his peers. “These sorts of encounters are becoming commonplace for reporters in #ageofrage,” was how Sky News’ presenter Adam Boulton put it. While he is right to be concerned, to contextualise the event as part of a generalised “age of rage” is misplaced. There is a difference between irritating online debate on all sides of the political spectrum, and physical harassment of journalists carried out by the far right.

‘Never stop dreaming’: refugees get behind the camera – in pictures

Robin Hammond has spent two decades crisscrossing the developing world and telling other people’s stories. From photographing the Rohingya forced out of Myanmar and rape survivors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to documenting the lives of people in countries where their sexuality is illegal, his work has earned him award after award.
But for his latest project the photographer has embarked on a paradigm shift: to remove himself – and others like him – from the process entirely. Instead, as part of an in-depth exploration of the refugee experience in Europe, the stories of those featured are told by those who, arguably, know them best: other refugees.

I received my first prison sentence in December 1957. I was 14. Set firmly, as I was, on a path of criminality, I vowed to get to know the workings of the system that held me. In crime, as in life, mistakes occur. And when they did, that knowledge allowed me to survive the 16 years, on and off, I resided in the dangerous prison system. 
I gave up crime in 2003 when, almost by accident, I began writing for this paper about the system I had left behind. But I have kept my hand in, as it were, on the state of penal play. This has led me to keep tabs on books, films and TV shows that claim to present an authentic look behind the high walls.

On 1 February this year, snow fell heavily on my home town of Worcester, Massachusetts, and I had been shovelling for an hour and a half before turning in at midnight. I was exhausted, but it’s my habit to watch movies on my phone as I go to sleep. I put on a favourite – the 1980s version of The Thing, starring Kurt Russell. It’s the story of researchers in Antarctica being gradually taken over by a malevolent alien. 
Within 10 minutes of the opening credits, I could barely keep my eyes open. The next thing I knew, four hours had passed, my wife, Heather, was asleep beside me and the movie had long finished. Groggily, I moved my phone off the pillow and removed the wireless AirPod headphone from one ear – the other had fallen out and I couldn’t find it.

Retail sales across Great Britain fell 1.4% last month as the government’s loosening of pandemic restrictions led to a drop in food shopping and an increase in eating and drinking in restaurants and bars.
The Office for National Statistics said the dip followed an exceptionally strong April, when sales rose 9.2%, as shoppers returned to the high street en masse when non-essential retailers reopened after a near four-month shutdown. Economists had forecast a 1.6% rise in sales in May.

On Thursday morning hundreds of officers from the Hong Kong police national security department raided the homes of the employees, including editor-in-chef Ryan Law, and the Apple Daily newsroom for the second time in less than a year. It froze millions of dollars in company assets.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s decision to remove two Coca-Cola bottles from view at a press conference, and dent the value of the fizzy drink maker’s sponsorship of the European Championship, has highlighted the risks brands face associating with sports stars made powerful by the social media era.
The Portugal captain, a renowned health fanatic who eschews carbonated drinks and alcohol, underlined his point by holding a bottle of water while saying “agua”, Portuguese and Spanish for water. The water brand in question happened to be owned by Coca-Cola too, but the damage – by a major sports star with 550 million social media followers – was done.

                    <span>England’s footballers will take the knee before their match against Scotland at Wembley tonight in an anti-racism protest that has divided supporters. Liam Rosenior and Paul MacInnes reflect on how football became enmeshed in the culture wars
When England’s footballers took to the pitch for their first match of Euro 2020 last Sunday they felt the weight of expectation as one of the tournament’s hotly tipped sides. But after a loudly bellowed national anthem, the team dropped to one knee on the Wembley turf for the anti-racism act that has become a mainstay of English football for the past year. Some of their own supporters loudly booed before the majority drowned them out in applause. 
Liam Rosenior, a former professional footballer currently on the coaching staff at Derby County, tells Anushka Asthana of his sadness but not surprise at the booing. He takes apart the argument that the players are making an overtly political statement and chastises politicians who he believes have sought to use the issue to inflame existing tensions. The Guardian’s sports reporter Paul MacInnes delves into the history of the gesture itself, which gained traction in the US on the back of the long-running anti-racism protest made by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

Drought is a hidden global crisis that risks becoming “the next pandemic” if countries do not take urgent action on water and land management and tackling the climate emergency, the UN has said.
At least 1.5 billion people have been directly affected by drought this century, and the economic cost over roughly that time has been estimated at $124bn (£89bn). The true cost is likely to be many times higher because such estimates do not include much of the impact in developing countries, according to a report published on Thursday.

                    <span>A hotly anticipated US government report on decades of mysterious sightings of UFOs is due for release this month. The Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt and former Ministry of Defence employee Nick Pope investigate
In December 2020, just before Donald Trump left the White House, the CIA was given six months to release all of the evidence it had gathered in the last 14 years about UFOs. So later this month a highly anticipated report will be released. 
Guardian reporter Adam Gabbatt tells Anushka Asthana that in recent years a series of government videos showing unidentified objects have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong object flying through the sky near San Diego in 2004. The wave of recent videos and the imminent release of the government report has ignited excitement around unidentified flying objects not seen for years.

Israel’s longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, was ousted from office on Sunday by a coalition of rival parties from across the political spectrum. Yair Lapid, a centrist former TV news anchor, won a confidence vote in parliament by 60 to 59 seats giving the new coalition a razor-thin majority.

But the new coalition of eight parties is far from stable.

                    <span>Writer Andrzej Łukowski is very happy with his family-sized flat in London. But his wife Rachael dreams of moving to the country. Can they resolve their differences without a mediator? 
I say: ‘It took me 28 years to move to London – I want to stay here’ 
OK, I never actually thought the streets were paved with gold. But London is the place I always wanted to live. I grew up in beautiful Birmingham – did you know it has more canals than Venice? – but I spent endless hours reading about theatre shows and gigs happening in the Big Smoke. I was the last of my friends to make the move here and when I finally did, it did not disappoint. I’d easily go out every single night in a week.
Although being married and having children changes that lifestyle, I still go to the theatre a lot. Having a family and a decent flat with a roof terrace is honestly more than I ever hoped for.

Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians
