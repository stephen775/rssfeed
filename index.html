Brazil’s environment minister has quit amid a criminal investigation into whether he obstructed a police inquiry into illegal logging in the Amazon rainforest.
A supreme court justice authorised the investigation of Ricardo Salles after federal police raids targeted the minister and other officials alleged to have allowed illegal wood exports.

Boris Johnson’s government has set “historic” targets on the climate crisis but has failed so far to come up with the policies needed to reach them, the government’s independent advisers on the climate have warned.
The Climate Change Committee published two progress reports on Thursday, showing the UK lagging behind on its key goal of 78% cuts to greenhouse gases by 2035 and making recommendations on how to get back on track.

Nearly half of all students thought their degree offered poor value for money this year, according to a survey that sheds light on the scale of student anger with their universities’ response to the pandemic.
Twice as many students thought their courses offered poor value (44%) than in 2019-20, despite pandemic disruption that year, according to the survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. The increase is thought to reflect a view among students that universities misled them about how much in-person teaching they could expect this year.

The all-female W Series has announced it is to introduce a new team competition for 2021. The championship’s second season begins on Saturday as a support race to the Styrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring in Austria. As well as partnering with Formula One, which will host all eight of its races, the series is to transition this year by introducing new liveries and partners in an innovative expansion of its structure and funding.
The championship aimed at promoting women in motorsport as drivers and engineers – and with the intent of helping put a female driver into F1 – completed a successful debut season in 2019. Last year however the season was cancelled because of the pandemic.

A historic offshore wind auction by the Queen’s property manager, the crown estate, helped to counter a sharp drop in the value of its retail portfolio, but could not prevent a 22% decline in annual profits to £269m.
The crown estate, which manages the seabed around Britain as well as a vast land and property portfolio that includes Windsor Great Park and Regent Street and St James’s district in London, said its profit for the year to March fell by nearly £76m from the year before, mainly due to a drop in its rent take.

Using data collected by the workspace company IWG on what people want to wear during their return to work, Deacon set about creating the wonky WFA (work from anywhere) outfits. Although searches for suits have increased 49% between April and May, according to Digital Loft, IWG found that generation Z workers also want to express their individuality through their clothes. “In a working environment people want to have a sense of personality,” Deacon said. “The traditional monochrome office suit is over.”

Coronavirus – latest updates

More than 2 million adults in England have experienced coronavirus symptoms lasting over 12 weeks, government data suggests – double the previous estimate for long Covid.
The study, one of the largest to date, found that people with ongoing symptoms tended to fall into two categories: those with respiratory symptoms, who often experienced more severe illness when they first got sick, and a second group with fatigue-related symptoms.

The figures, released for the first time in the Queen’s annual financial accounts, come three months after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex accused the royal family of racism in their controversial Oprah Winfrey interview, a claim publicly denied by Prince William.

The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has been cleared of misleading an inquiry into the London Capital &amp; Finance investment scandal, but an influential committee of MPs has found that the regulator he ran until last year “fell short” in its duty to protect the public.
In a new report, MPs on the Treasury select committee said that after the high-profile collapse of London Capital &amp; Finance (LC&amp;F), which saw thousands of people lose money, the Financial Conduct Authority needed to be “more interventionist” and “should make more frequent use of its powers”.

                    <span>National Theatre, London
Lyndsey Turner’s production is a charming albeit emotionally distanced retreat into nostalgia
Dylan Thomas’s drama, broadcast on radio in 1954 , has been recited by pre-eminent Welsh voices from Thomas himself to Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins. Now Michael Sheen gives us this day in the life of Llareggub, Thomas’s fictitious seaside village in Wales. It is hard to go wrong with this tour de force of oral poetry which oozes word pictures and onomatopoeic musicality. Lyndsey Turner’s production does it justice, accentuating the earthy comedy and romanticism of intimately lived village life. It tries to capture Thomas’s pace too: gorgeous linguistic sprints that turn to a quiet maudlin ambling.
Sheen – shaggy, bearded and full of humanity – leads as the narrator but this is really an ensemble show, animated with amusing turns by Siân Phillips, Cleo Sylvestre and Ifan Huw Dafydd among others. It comes with an inventive framing device (additional material is written by Siân Owen) in which Sheen plays the son of Richard Jenkins (Karl Johnson), who is losing his bearings when he is visited by Jenkins Junior in his nursing home. Thomas’s narrative is used to jog Jenkins’s memory and bring him back to the present moment, and to his son. The father-son relationship contains powerful undercurrents of tension and unspoken history, and is movingly performed by both actors.

“I am a change agent,” declared Emma Walmsley, as she unveiled the biggest overhaul of GlaxoSmithKline in the 20-odd years of the company’s life in its current form. The consumer healthcare division will depart via a plain-vanilla demerger next year; shareholders will have to live with a sharply reduced dividend; and “new GSK” will seek salvation for its rotten share price by investing more heavily in its core business of pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
That’s the outline of the changes, but the edges went a little blurry on close inspection. Why will GSK retain up to 20% of its two-thirds stake in a consumer business as a “short-term financial investment”? Possibly because it wants to cling to the comfort blanket of the consumer division’s reliable cashflows a little longer.

Manager says his side ‘need to improve’ after Hungary scare

Joachim Löw has warned Germany that they cannot repeat their group stage mistakes when they face England at Wembley on Tuesday, otherwise their participation in Euro 2020 will be over.
Germany flirted with disaster against Hungary on stormy night in Munich, coming six minutes from finishing bottom of Group F and exiting the tournament at the first hurdle. Leon Goretzka’s late goal lifted them back into second place and meant an error-strewn defensive showing was not severely punished.

Catalan’s regional police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, confirmed a report in El País that McAfee, 75, had been found dead in the Brians 2 prison near Barcelona, late on Wednesday.

Between 2018 and 2020, life expectancy for Americans declined 1.87 years, 8.5 times worse than the average decline in life expectancy in 16 peer nations, and the most precipitous decline since the second world war.

                    <span>Concerns that burnout and pension tax bills are taking toll on NHS ranks as younger medics quit
The number of doctors retiring early has more than trebled since 2008, prompting fears that burnout and high pension tax bills are prompting medics to leave the NHS.
While 401 GPs and hospital doctors in England and Wales took early retirement in 2007-08, that number had soared to 1,358 in 2020-21 – an increase of 239% in 13 years.

Britney Spears speaks at last: will her day in court upend all we thought we knew?

Britney Spears has called for an end to the “abusive” conservatorship that has governed her life for 13 years, delivering an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court and saying: “I want my life back.”
Spears addressed the court during a hearing on the unusual legal arrangement that has stripped the singer of her independence since 2008. The conservatorship has given her father, Jamie Spears, control over her estate, career and other aspects of her personal life.

British ministers will have been under no illusions that the decision to sail HMS Defender into disputed waters off the coast of Russian-annexed Crimea would provoke a reaction from the Kremlin.
A dispute about whether warning shots were fired or not is beside the point – although if they were, they were miles out of range. Because even if the west considers Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, to be still part of Ukraine, the Russians do not and will act accordingly.

                    <span>Portugal occupied every position in Group F at various stages of an epic contest in Budapest. At the precise moment Cristiano Ronaldo faced Hugo Lloris for the second time from the penalty spot, the European champions were out of the Euros. He also had the small matter of equalling the all-time international goalscoring record set by Iran’s Ali Daei at his feet. The weight of history, and of responsibility, does not faze a legend. Ronaldo swept home goal 109 and Portugal through.
France also had a two-goal inspiration in Karim Benzema, who silenced the debate over his importance to Didier Deschamps’ team with a commanding performance. The Real Madrid forward struck his first goals for France since his international exile ended after almost six years and, while the world champions have yet to truly hit their stride, a first-place finish in this group does not represent a shabby start.

                    <span>On the one hand Gareth Southgate may feel gratified but, on the other, he might detect significant cause for concern. Surely Germany will be better than this when they face England at Wembley on Tuesday, an outcome that for most of a chaotic night seemed beyond them, and if they are not then those Euro 96 ghosts will probably be banished at last. They were six minutes from finishing bottom of Group F and this result was an affront to a dogged, clever Hungary side who came close to completing a shock for the ages.
It would have been Hungary rolling back the years, albeit a few decades further, in London if the substitute Leon Goretzka had not hammered low past Peter Gulacsi from 16 yards to equalise and break their hearts.

Jos Buttler further embellished an outstanding record at the top of England’s order with a ninth half-century in 20 innings as opener to power England to an eight-wicket victory over an emphatically outplayed Sri Lanka, whose sub-par display was summed up by the game’s final moment.
With three overs remaining and just one run required for victory Buttler hit an uncharacteristically wild shot and edged to the tourists’ captain and wicketkeeper, Kusal Perera. Buttler set off towards the dressing-rooms assuming the worst, but the ball flicked off the webbing of Perera’s right glove and England’s batsman just slightly amended his path and walked to the other end to complete a single and with it the match.

The new measures, which will be some of the toughest marketing restrictions in the world, will heavily impact the more than £600m spent by brands on all food advertising online and on TV annually.

Manchester United have indicated to Borussia Dortmund that they are prepared to raise their offer for Jadon Sancho to £73m (€85m) as they close in on the signing of the England forward.
Negotiations with Dortmund have been ongoing for several weeks after United refused to match the German club’s valuation last summer, with the 21-year-old former Manchester City player thought to be available for £77.5m (€90m). But with Sancho already having agreed personal terms on a five-year deal worth about £350,000 a week, it is understood that United’s latest offer could tempt Dortmund into doing business for a player who has two years left on his contract.

Travel thousands of metres below the surface of the ocean, and you reach the seabed. Pitch black and quiet, it is largely unexplored, untouched, unknown.
What is known is extraordinary. The landscape at the bottom of the sea is as varied as the earth surface: 4,000m (13,000ft) down, abyssal plains stretch for miles like deserts; there are trenches large enough to swallow the Earth’s largest mountains; venting chimneys rise in towers like underwater cities; seamounts climb thousands of metres. Hot thermal vents – believed by some to be the places where all life on Earth started – gush highly acidic water at temperatures of up to 400C, drawing in an array of creatures.

Dalian Atkinson’s family told of their relief and continuing pain after a five-year battle for justice saw a British police officer become the first in 35 years to be convicted of manslaughter while on duty.
PC Benjamin Monk used excessive force when he fired an electric stun gun into the former professional footballer for 33 seconds – six times longer than is standard – and kicked him twice in the head as he lay on the ground, a jury found.

He had once thrilled tens of thousands of people in football stadiums in England, Turkey and Spain. Now he was causing concern to two of those closest to him: his partner, Karen Wright, and Jonty, the friend whose house he was staying in.

“They jabber, we jab. They dither, we deliver. They vacillate, we vaccinate.” It’s asking a lot of an overindulged narcissist, but a man with even a patina of emotional intelligence might have realised that to accuse Labour of jabbering when Keir Starmer had used his six questions at prime minister’s questions to challenge the government’s record on the appallingly low rate of rape prosecutions and convictions was at best crass and at worst offensive.
But then Boris just can’t help himself. When the pressure’s on, the mask slips. The third-rate gag – don’t forget it was Johnson who once described investigations into non-recent child sex offences as money spaffed up a wall – is his modus operandi. It’s how he has traditionally tried to rescue himself from difficult circumstances. Do anything to raise a laugh from somewhere and hope to defuse the situation. Only when the subject matter is rape, it’s just not funny.

Williamson half century leads New Zealand to eight-wicket win

Two years after their heartbreak in the World Cup final at Lord’s, New Zealand returned to English soil and emerged triumphant, an eight-wicket victory over India meaning Kane Williamson’s men were crowned the inaugural world Test champions at the end of a dramatic sixth day that stirred the senses.
Gone was the miserable rain that pushed this showpiece into a reserve day, the sun smiling on Williamson as he lifted the ICC’s Test mace in Southampton. The Black Caps’ commitment to whole-hearted, ego-free cricket and a collective purpose delivered the silverware they so richly deserve.

Millions of homes face a winter energy bill hike of over £110 a year due to a surge in commodity market prices to almost 13-year highs, according to industry experts.
A standard gas and electricity bill is expected to climb to an average of £1,250 a year this winter after a “massive price hike” as global energy markets soar to prices not seen since 2008.

The women behind the first company to make glasses specifically for black faces says the eyewear industry treats the black community as an “afterthought”.
Kimeze was launched by sisters Clare and Christina Kimeze in London last month after being frustrated with the lack of glasses that properly fit the faces of members of the black community. They say that black shoppers are being overlooked by the industry, with the majority of glasses on the high street made with only a Caucasian face shape and size in mind. “None are made specifically for black features,” says Clare. “As a community, we have historically been an afterthought.”

Britain was unexpectedly embroiled in a diplomatic and military dispute with Russia on Wednesday after Royal Navy destroyer HMS Defender briefly sailed through territorial waters off the coast of the disputed territory of Crimea.
The warship sailed for about an hour in the morning within the 12-mile limit off Cape Fiolent on a direct route between the Ukrainian port of Odesa and Georgia, prompting Russian complaints and a disagreement about whether warning shots were fired.

The chief executive of the manager of Grenfell Tower has blamed his staff for allowing the block’s fire safety plan to become 15 years out of date so it failed to account for more than two dozen of the disabled people in the block.
Robert Black, the most senior executive at the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organisation (TMO), told the public inquiry into the disaster that the obsolete plan showing no more than 12 vulnerable or disabled people was caused by staff not carrying out managers’ instructions. The tower was in fact home to 37 disabled people and 15 of them died. The inquiry has heard claims from lawyers for the bereaved that the fire was a “landmark act of discrimination against disabled and vulnerable people”.

Lawyers representing a woman who killed her stepfather turned husband after 24 years of violence that started when he raped her at 12 are taking legal action against the French state for “gross negligence” after claims the authorities failed to act on reports she was being abused.
Valérie Bacot’s defence team said a summons for liability had been filed with the Paris tribunal. Her lawyers point out that her children twice went to the police to report their father – who was Bacot’s stepfather – for abusing her but no action was taken.

To sensible Conservatives, Channel 4 should seem a bargain. Owned by the state, it costs the taxpayer precisely nothing. It generates income from advertising – both from linear TV and streaming – that it ploughs back into Britain’s lively independent production sector, without the need for it to make a profit for shareholders. It was Margaret Thatcher’s government that brought it to fruition, after the seeds of the channel were sown by Lord Annan’s 1977 report into the future of broadcasting. It was designed to stimulate independent production beyond the BBC and ITV, reflecting the full diversity of Britain’s talent – and so it did. Some would say it has lost much of the iconoc…</span>

                    <span>Boris Johnson’s political tactics against Labour in England might have unintended consequences north of the border
Boris Johnson’s method for protecting the union from Scottish independence is not a secret. He will say no to a second referendum. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, this week confirmed as much, saying he could not envisage circumstances in which the prime minister would yield to any demand Nicola Sturgeon might make for a plebiscite in the current parliament.
The first independence vote in 2014 was arranged by the coordination of Holyrood and Westminster parliaments. An order under section 30 of the Scotland Act was granted, paving the way for referendum legislation. David Cameron understood how dangerous it would be if an English prime minister used Westminster’s legal supremacy to sabotage Scottish National party plans. It would go against the principle of consent on which the union is founded, inflaming the grievance that most drives support for independence – a feeling that Scots lack control over their national destiny.

Coronavirus – latest updates

The many masked faces visible outdoors at Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester city centre on Wednesday afternoon reflect the fact that, for many, wearing one is a question of choice, routine and personal comfort as much as adherence to government regulations.
Maskwearing is mandated indoors including in shops, supermarkets and on public transport but that could all change amid reports that England is on track to drop social distancing and face mask requirements on 19 July.

The World Health Organization has said it has concerns about the methods used at one plant producing the Sputnik V vaccine, as Slovakia announced it would sell or donate 160,000 of the 200,000 doses it has ordered of the Russian shot.
The WHO, which along with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is reviewing Sputnik V for eventual approval, said in a report on Wednesday it had issues with the integrity of quality control data and test results at one of the four production sites it had seen.

Angela Merkel has said travellers from the UK should be quarantined wherever they arrive in the EU, as the union’s agency for disease control forecast that the Delta variant of Covid will account for 90% of cases in member states by the end of August.
Ahead of Thursday’s summit with fellow EU leaders, the German chancellor said she wanted better coordination to fight the spread of the highly transmissible variant that has surfaced strongly in the UK and is now bedding down in the bloc.

The high court in Dublin will consider the damages to be paid to Rebecca Price and Patrick Kiely on Wednesday after medical personnel and institutions involved in the case admitted liability.

Plus letters from Prof Diane Reay, Alexander Verney-Elliott, Chris Hughes, Jack Gingell, Michael Pike and Bill Dhadli
As members of the education select committee, we have spent months listening to evidence from experts for the report on education and white working-class pupils (Tory MPs accused of adding fuel to ‘culture war’ in education report, 21 June). There is no doubt in our minds that there are children in this country that have been badly let down, but as Labour members on the committee we decided to vote against it.
The evidence we received clearly indicated that the main determining factors of poor educational outcomes were class and regional inequalities caused by more than a decade of austerity. Put simply, where a child is born and raised has much more of a bearing on academic outcomes than their ethnicity does. Despite this, the Tory committee members decided to include a whole section on “white privilege”.

Would it be unfair to suggest that the cabinet’s “do or die” social care meeting was cancelled (Report, 21 June) because Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock still have no idea what to “do” and consider that the “die” bit was quite adequately covered in the first weeks of the pandemic?

                    <span>Being cut, aged 10, led to extraordinary pain and complications in childbirth. Now Hussein’s campaign to end mutilation has led to a staggering change in attitudes
Sadia Hussein had been in labour for three days when she felt she could take no more. She could hear her mother crying in the distance, pleading with God to save her daughter’s life.
But even though things were clearly not progressing as they should have been, the women in her small Kenyan village were resistant to the idea of sending her to hospital. Her mother told her that doctors would “tear her apart” with a pair of scissors; that, at home, they could at least use a razor. “So now, on top of the overwhelming pain of labour, there was this continuous cutting,” Hussein recalls.

                    <span>To be loud and annoying is the definition of a protest, so it’s shocking that the new Police Crackdown bill would criminalise this. Time to raise our voices while we can
I am a feminist but one time I went on a women’s rights march, popped into a department store to use the loo, got distracted trying out face cream and when I came out the march was gone. The first time I admitted this in public I was worried I would get kicked out of the feminist club, but I discovered that many, many, many women have left a march at half-time. Some quite famous feminists have told me they have snuck off to the pub for a cheeky half, planning to go back out, and woken up with a hangover. Still, I have to think that going to a protest, being counted and raising your voice is, like many things in life, better than not going at all – even if you get overwhelmed by the crowd and don’t quite make it to the finish line.
The British have a reputation for being quiet and polite but there’s a long tradition of us being noisy and annoying. It is how we got everything we treasure, from votes for people who aren’t posh landowners to gay weddings. We even protested to get two days off a week and invented the weekend. We have saved libraries, protested both for and against Brexit, and last summer overturned dodgy exam algorithms. We ended the European Super League before it began. Taking to the street with a wry placard that reads: “I’m very cross!” or: “I can’t believe I’m still protesting this shit” is our way of life.

The basic terribleness of this film is beside the point. Everything in this film, in fact, is beside the point, save for the fact that it stars the genetic miracle of the modern age, the all-time winner of the Dorian Gray award for looking younger than your age, more impressive even than Paul Rudd … the legendary William Shatner. Shatner plays Victor Martin, a roguish old Viagra-popping womaniser who loses his driving licence after a prang. He winds up having to take the bus, where he meets-cute with a lovely lady close to his age range, cafe owner Caroline Summers, played by Jean Smart (last seen as Kate Winslet’s mum in TV’s Mare of Easttown).

For North Korea, it is a rousing anthem with a bold opening line: “Let morning shine on the silver and gold of our land.” For Vladimir Putin, it’s a chanson-like melody, Where does the motherland begin?, from his favourite Soviet spy film. And for Gavin Williamson, it’s a new “patriotic” song with the chorus line “Strong Britain, Great Nation”.
The education secretary has provoked outrage – both real and amused – for suggesting children should sing the song on Friday to mark “One Britain, One Nation” (OBON) day. Williamson has praised the campaign by a former policeman, Kash Singh, and encouraged all schools to take part. “Children can learn about our shared values of tolerance, kindness, pride and respect,” the education department tweeted.

Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, will shut down online at midnight on Wednesday and print its final edition on Thursday, in a move observers fear signals the death knell for press freedom in the territory. 
The paper and its activist founder, Jimmy Lai, had become symbols of the pro-democracy movement and a thorn in the side of Hong Kong’s government and police, making it a prime target in the government’s efforts to stifle Hong Kong’s media.

This time last year there was no Covid vaccine and none was imminent. Today, about 43 million Britons – 80% of the UK adult population – have had a dose. The ordeal is far from over, but this will be the crux of the story when future generations narrate Britain’s pandemic: the virus brought fear and death; science replied with vaccines and hope.
The associated political debates will go on in the margins. The jabs may have transformed Boris Johnson’s poll ratings, but that reflects a feelgood factor, which is not bankable. It cannot be deployed later in the year if voters feel bad about something else. The significance of the smooth vaccine rollout to the prime minister’s longer-term reputation depends on whether it is a late bloom of sustained administrative competence or, as seems likelier, a fluke, to be followed by a resumption of 2020-style disarray and prevarication.

Boxing is likely to be one of the sports that offers Team GB the best opportunity to win medals at the Tokyo Olympics and Wednesday’s announcement of the squad of seven men and four women confirmed its depth and quality. Olympic boxing often resembles a lottery because so much depends on wayward judges and the vagaries of the draw. Yet this squad looks to be at least as strong as its London 2012 counterpart which won five medals.
The GB team then relied heavily on Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell and Nicola Adams, who all won gold, while the 2021 squad has a much deeper pool of talent. All 11 British fighters in Tokyo can claim to be in medal contention, if they get the right draw, and that was not true of the GB teams in London and then at Rio in 2016 when three medals were won.

                    <span>Analysis: a palpable chill has run through the Hong Kong media, amid warnings about ‘fake news’
The fate of Apple Daily, one of Hong Kong’s bestselling tabloids, should not come as a surprise. On the day Jimmy Lai, its founder, was sentenced to 14 months in prison in April, a commentary in the pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao called for a ban on Apple Daily in order to “close national security loopholes”.
The 72-year-old media tycoon and his 26-year-old newspaper have been among the most high-profile critics of Beijing and the controversial national security law (NSL), which they deem “draconian”, but which the authorities say is “necessary”. The law bars secession, subversion and foreign collusion.

The Night Watch by Rembrandt has enraptured millions visiting Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum and its previous homes over the centuries, dazzling with its scale and fine detail.
But it is only from today, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence to recapture some of the Dutch master’s genius, including the sweep of his brush strokes and perspective of his eye, that it can for the first time in 300 years be enjoyed in its complete form.

Here is the latest information from a Home Office press briefing on the EU settlement scheme (EUSS). It says it has been inundated with applications and has had 1.5m calls to its helplines. It has recently changed its messaging to stop people repeatedly calling and clogging the lines.

When Confessions of a Shopaholic, directed by PJ Hogan, of Muriel’s Wedding acclaim, was released in 2009 – a year that brought us the high-octane, male-dominated likes of The Hangover, Sherlock Holmes and Inglourious Basterds – it was the tail end of the romcom’s golden age. And, just like its genre-mates released that year – Bride Wars, He’s Just Not That Into You, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past – Shopaholic received a wave of scathing reviews, weighing in at just 26% on Rotten Tomatoes.

With another full supermoon rising – this time the June ‘strawberry moon’ on Thursday night across the world – many people will pull out their mobile phones to try and get an Instagram-worthy photograph, but unfortunately it’s really challenging to take a great picture of the moon.
Two reasons: it is very far away and unless you have a telephoto lens (which makes the moon appear closer than it is) it will always appear as a very small glowing dot in the frame.

                    <span>Recent French regional elections suggest next year’s contest won’t simply be Macron versus the far right
On Sunday, France held the first round of this year’s regional elections – and two-thirds of eligible voters chose to stay home. As the country slowly emerges from lockdown, politics is clearly not a priority for most people. While it may be a fool’s errand to try to interpret the voice of the people when the vast majority preferred to remain silent, Sunday’s voting has changed the conversation about what lies ahead.
Voters were asked to choose the representatives who will govern France’s 18 regions (13 domestic and five overseas). In their current form, the regions are only five years old, the product of the most recent of many efforts to add a modicum of decentralisation to France’s traditionally top-down administrative setup.

I have no idea whether Too Hot to Handle (Netflix) was filmed before or during the pandemic and it seems unnecessary to ask. It would just have been a case of adding one more test to what I imagine is already quite an exhaustive list before the contestants are let loose on a poor unsuspecting island as part of an apparent reality dating show and quest to find and rate each other’s genitals as quickly as possible. A lateral flow swab would be a mere bagatelle compared to everything they must go through not to turn each season of this into an STI fest. How they get any of the pathologically energetic contestants to stay still for a medical procedure would be a programme in itself. I suspect the use of tranquilising blowdarts.
Maybe season three will take us behind the scenes, but for now we must face – with strength, determination and at least 5mg of Valium – season two of Too Hot to Handle, AKA Horn 4 U, AKA Blind Date Goes Rogue, AKA Am I 108 Years Old?, AKA Are These People Real?, AKA Just Make It Stop.

                    <span>The opposition leader’s misguided attempt to ‘win the right to be heard’ has only driven away his own base
The news this week that Keir Starmer is parting ways with his director of communications, deputy director of communications, chief of staff, and his political director may bring an end to an unusual experiment in political communications that has been under way inside Labour. This innovative approach to messaging has attracted some attention for its lack of memorable policies (remember “British Recovery Bonds”?). But its main feature has been the unconventional insistence, from Starmer and his top team, that voters are right to shun Labour, who deserve to lose, in favour of the Tories, who are frankly doing such an excellent job that they will naturally keep winning.
The seeds of this approach were first sown by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in the aftermath of the 2019 election defeat, when he said the British public got it right by voting Tory. The baton was soon picked up by the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, who was keen to stress in her leadership campaign that Labour must “change or die”.

In February 2010, Beyoncé performed in Trinidad, insisted on making an appearance at one of the hottest clubs in Port of Spain (much to the obvious dismay of her bodyguards), and flew home. It was the final stop on her I Am … World Tour. A few months earlier, she had cancelled two subsequent dates without explanation. If she regretted it, it didn’t show.
A year later, in the documentary short Year of 4, she explained her decision. “After I finished the last tour, I was a bit overwhelmed and overworked. And my mother was the person that preached to me, and almost harassed me every day … ‘You really need to live your life and open your eyes, and you don’t want to wake up with no memories.’”

You, of course, should adjust it according to what’s good near you.

Almost two-thirds of wind and solar projects built globally last year will be able to generate cheaper electricity than even the world’s cheapest new coal plants, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).
The agency found that the falling cost of new windfarms and solar panels meant 62% of new renewable energy projects could undercut the cost of up to 800 gigawatts (GW) worth of coal plants, or almost enough to supply the UK’s electricity needs 10 times over.

                    <span>He says he has no issues with it, but I want to be as sexually satisfied as he is and feel rejected
My husband and I have been married for two years. We have a relatively healthy sex life but he does not reciprocate with oral sex. When confronted, he said he has no issue surrounding it, he just feels it is not necessary. I feel rejected and that the focus is primarily on him reaching an orgasm, with no focus on my enjoyment. How can I have a conversation with him without him getting defensive? I have never had an orgasm through penetrative sex and, in previous relationships, I have loved receiving oral sex.
Your husband needs to be educated regarding your precise needs and the nature of female arousal and orgasm in general. It seems as if you have been extremely patient and accommodating until now, so it is probably no wonder he sees no reason to change his style. And he may be afraid he will not know exactly what to do, so you will have to help him by being very specific about what feels good. Try to frame your request for oral pleasuring in a highly seductive, playful manner – so that he realises he will be rewarded for his efforts. Once he learns that your arousal is a great turn on for him, he will be more motivated to complete the task.

I fear I will never be able to see my family again because of Home Office blunders. I applied for a spouse visa in July 2020. I didn’t receive a decision, but in January it emailed to say it had recently sent me a biometric residence permit (it hadn’t) with the wrong expiry date, and asked me to return it. I’ve since tried to establish whether they have mixed my file up with someone else’s and what my status is. The Home Office hasn’t responded to my formal complaint within the requisite 20-day window, or to my MP’s intervention. It’s been more than 18 months since I last saw my family in Canada and the US, and three of my relatives are seriously ill. I have plans for a reunion in July, but the likelihood of that is dwindling, and my heart breaks a little more every day.
SH, London
Visa delays are among the most distressing complaints in my inbox, and they are proliferating. Most are from applicants who have been waiting up to 18 months for a decision. Your case stands out because there’s clearly been an error, and the Home Office doesn’t appear to be interested in addressing it.

                    <span>Around the world, dozens of ingenious projects are trying to ‘trick’ the ocean into absorbing more CO2. But critics warn of unforeseen consequences
Tom Green has a plan to tackle climate change. The British biologist and director of the charity Project Vesta wants to turn a trillion tonnes of CO2 into rock, and sink it to the bottom of the sea.
Green admits the idea is “audacious”. It would involve locking away atmospheric carbon by dropping pea-coloured sand into the ocean. The sand is made of ground olivine – an abundant volcanic rock, known to jewellers as peridot – and, if Green’s calculations are correct, depositing it offshore on 2% of the world’s coastlines would capture 100% of total global annual carbon emissions.

                    <span>Once, people who owned viral photos made little money from them. Now, the ‘original’ can potentially sell for an enormous sum. But are buyers savvy investors – or unwitting dupes?
The photographer Jeff McCurry’s favourite Harambe memes are the ones where the dead gorilla is in heaven, Photoshopped alongside Diana, Princess of Wales, Tupac and Muhammad Ali. “It’s like: wow,” says McCurry. “What greater spot can you be placed in? Harambe’s at the top of the hill, waiting to meet you there.”
McCurry took the photograph of the 17-year-old western lowland gorilla that went on to become a meme. In it, Harambe kneels, projecting a fearsome aura of strength, nobility and calm. A former volunteer photographer at Cincinnati zoo, McCurry was there on 28 May 2016, the fateful day a three-year-old boy climbed into the gorilla’s enclosure, forcing zookeepers to shoot Harambe dead. “It didn’t seem real at first,” says McCurry, who was a regular visitor to the zoo. “When any of your friends die, it’s hard to process. I was in shock.”

Then in the small hours came a political thunderbolt almost no one had forecast: the UK had voted to leave the union. Five years on, the Brexit tempest has subsided – in Brussels, if not in London.

                    <span>The brutal murder of a private investigator in 1987 has become the UK’s most investigated killing – but 34 years later it remains unsolved and mired in new official findings of police corruption
On 10 March 1987, a 37-year-old private investigator named Daniel Morgan was found dead in a south London pub car park with an axe embedded in his head. Despite the arrests of several men, the initial investigation did not lead to any charges and the murder has gone unsolved amid allegations of police corruption. 
The Metropolitan police have previously accepted that corrupt officers shielded the killers. But a new panel inquiry concluded last week that the crime was probably “solvable” had it not been undermined. The force was described as “institutionally corrupt” and its commissioner, Cressida Dick, personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry.

                    <span>Over 4 million people are involved in open-water swimming in Britain. The Outdoor Swimming Society’s longest swim on the longest day event has more than 500 participants – we joined several groups out for solstice swims around the UK on a damp and grey summer’s day
The pandemic has been a tough time for swimmers. Lockdowns and tier systems meant swimming pools were closed for more days than they were open. Outdoor swimming spots were only for use by those local enough to access them easily.
However, despite the restrictions, there has been a huge surge in the popularity of swimming, particularly outdoor swimming in ponds, lakes, reservoirs or the sea.

When most birds walk, their heads snap backwards and forwards – pigeons being probably the most extreme example. Ducks’ heads don’t seem to do this. Why do ducks not and those others do? And which other birds’ heads don’t move as they walk? David Cockayne, Cheshire

A new wave of Covid-19 cases is threatening to disrupt another summer in the UK as the government extends restrictions for England into July amid concern about the rate of spread of the Delta variant. 
The Guardian’s health editor, Sarah Boseley, tells Anushka Asthana that this time around we are in a very different position with most adults now having had two vaccine jabs. However, there is still a prospect of a sharp rise in Covid cases and with it more hospital admissions and deaths. Boris Johnson has said cases of the Delta variant are rising at about 30% a week.

Karim Ennarah, a human rights worker for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, was at a beach resort in South Sinai when he was arrested and accused of joining a terrorist group and “spreading false news”. He was detained in a prison in Cairo and became one of thousands of political prisoners in the country. 
Ennarah tells Anushka Asthana that his arrest was only the beginning of his separation from his British wife. Jess Kelly describes to Anushka the moment that she found out her husband had been arrested by the security services as she rode her bike along a London street, and the great difficulties she herself has faced to be reunited with him.

An image-to-text conversion makes it possible to extract text from images to automate the processing of texts on images, videos, and scanned documents.

                    <span>Lucy Crane is eco-conscious to her core – at work and at home. She talks to Anna Turns about sustainable lithium mining in Cornwall and selling pre-loved spectacles online
For geologist Lucy Crane, retrofitting the 1960s property she has just moved into is all about future-proofing. Just a minute’s walk from the Cornish coast near Pendennis Castle in Falmouth, the two-bedroom house is hot as a greenhouse during the day and cold at night – plus there’s no central heating, just a few storage heaters.
“It would be madness for us to put in a gas boiler when we need to be moving away from fossil fuels,” says Crane, who is expecting her first child with her partner Alex, a naval officer.

                    <span>Energy expert Prof Mohamed Pourkashanian believes that today’s younger people are set to take the lead in a green revolution – one that could be powered by ‘clean’ hydrogen
“I have learned something good from the Covid-19 lockdown,” says Prof Mohamed Pourkashanian. “I used to travel maybe twice a month to meetings abroad, and once or twice to meetings around the UK – but I have realised that 80% of what I did there, I can do online. That reduced need to travel will have an impact in terms of carbon reduction.”
Currently the head of University Energy Research at the University of Sheffield, in his 35 years working in the field, Pourkashanian has contributed to hundreds of papers on subjects including solar power, grid-scale batteries and carbon capture.

Two weeks after the 16-year-old was pulled from the rubble, he leaves hospital to visit his remaining family and return to what’s left of his devastated neighbourhood in Gaza City. Many of Omar’s neighbours also lost loved ones, and search through the rubble for possessions, after a war which killed more than 250 people in Israel and Gaza, the vast majority of them Palestinians

                    <span>It may still sound like the stuff of science fiction, but some of the biggest companies in the world are investing hugely in previously fanciful transport technologies

From 2030, new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned in Britain – a sure sign that we’re on the threshold of a transport revolution. But what exactly will this revolution look like? With estimates that the market for autonomous vehicles could be worth almost £42bn in just over a decade, the future of transport looks to be anything but boring. Here are five things you need to know …
Driverless cars take to the roads
While fully autonomous vehicles (where the driver could, in theory, watch a film while the vehicle takes the controls) are still a way off, the first driverless cars – with automated lane-keeping systems that allow drivers to safely take their hands off the wheel – could be on Britain’s roads this year. In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix. The road to the driverless future may still be a little bumpy, but it is showing signs of smoothing out.

                    <span>Harnessing the power of the sun is one of the most exciting and viable sources of renewable energy. Here’s the low-down on our brighter future
Every hour, enough solar power hits our planet to meet humanity’s energy needs for a year. So why aren’t we using it as one of our main sources of power? Well, as new technologies are helping us unlock more of the sun’s energy, the hope is that it will be key to our greener future. Here are five things you need to know about solar energy …
900,000 buildings in the UK have solar panels
The number of homes in Britain that have solar panels on the roof is heading towards one million and, if more of us sign up, solar energy could seriously boost Britain’s efforts to switch away from coal-fired power stations. The Solar Trade Association says that if 4.4m British homes were equipped with solar panels and battery set-ups, this could eliminate the evening surge in electricity demand on a winter’s day, reducing consumption at peak times by 97% annually.
