                <p>Some of us have a gift for gardening, others are feared by fauna. But have you come across a plant that remains durable no matter what?
Not all of us are naturally green-fingered – and so it is always a joy when a plant not only doesn’t immediately die but thrives in our care. Many of us will have, at some point, acquired a form of greenery that it has proved impossible to kill – even if you have an impressive track record when it comes to plant fatalities.

Donald Trump’s Facebook account should not be reinstated, the social media giant’s oversight board said on Wednesday, barring an imminent return to the platform.
However, the board has punted the final decision over Trump’s account back to Facebook itself, suggesting the platform make a decision in six months regarding what to do with Trump’s account and whether it will be permanently deleted.

Carrots are always with us. Even in the UK, the season is practically year round. Properly stored carrots can last for months. Improperly stored – which is the way I do it – they go a bit bendy after a couple of weeks. Their robustness also has a downside: we often use up more delicate purchases first, knowing the carrots will still be there in the fridge when the fun stuff has ru…</p>
