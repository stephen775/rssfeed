England played a European Championship game at Wembley and it was – and I had to look this word up, so apologies if the meaning isn’t quite right – enjoyable. People sang and cheered. The national stadium, so often a theatre of irritations, felt contented and boisterous. England shuffled diffidently – and not without a few grumbles – into the last 16. And on a night when Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire made their return, England’s leader on the field was a 19‑year‑old from west London with five caps to his name.\nElectrifying teenage attacker dances his way through a major tournament defence. We all think we’ve seen this film before, and if you listen closely you can probably already hear the weepy BBC montage at its end. But amid the complications and the paradoxes of England’s performance here, the uncertain fates and futures, one fact at least felt clear enough. As “It’s Coming Home” rained down from the stands, the stage belonged to a man born just a 92 bus ride from Wembley. Welcome – belatedly – to the summer of Bukayo Saka.\n Continue reading...",

Instead, comprehensive defeat. Perhaps that will be easier for the Tartan Army to stomach than any kind of glorious, cliched failure.\nAs inspired by Luka Modric – who else? – Croatia took a hammer to Steve Clarke’s dream. “No one is sure how he still manages to play to the level he still does,” the Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic said of Modric. “I can’t think of the words to describe it.” Join the club.\n Continue reading...",

Specifically on Channel 4, he said: “Its next, and most enduring, contribution to the UK media landscape may be to keep some of its distinctive remit but as part of adding useful scale to another UK-based operator.”\n Continue reading...",

We’re still nowhere near finding out if the government has a coherent plan for tackling social care – only late on Monday the prime minister cancelled a meeting with Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock due to take place on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issue. So we can probably assume not. But we are a little better informed as to why the negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol have started to unravel badly. And that’s because every time he speaks, the UK’s lead Brexit negotiator, David Frost, doesn’t seem to be quite as bright as he would like us all to believe.\nTuesday’s appearance before the foreign affairs select committee was a case in point. Having established his credentials as being rather more important than a minister for Europe, Lord Frost then did his best to prove why he wasn’t really up to the job. He got off to a bad start by saying that the decision not to fully accredit the EU ambassador to the UK had been “over-interpreted” and that petty point scoring had been the last thing on the government’s mind. For some reason, the EU had seen it differently and taken offence.\n Continue reading...",

But the nuclear deal’s resurrection is still possible and necessary\nThe election of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi as Iran’s new president is a dispiriting moment for those in the west striving to revive the nuclear deal. The Iranian electorate is hardly more enthusiastic. Battered by the economic fallout from Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement, the Covid pandemic and the inability of Hassan Rouhani’s reformist government to deliver on promises and overcome obstruction by the clergy and Revolutionary Guard, voters were offered only an engineered election in which Mr Raisi’s victory was all but certain.\nWhile past elections were tightly controlled – and the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retained ultimate control regardless of the outcome – they have nonetheless been genuinely competitive. This time, leading reformists and centrists were removed as 600 candidates were whittled down; just four stood in the end. Mr Raisi’s 62% of the vote came on a turnout of 48%; in Tehran just 26% voted. While participation has at times been low, this was an all-time nadir for a presidential race in the Islamic Republic, and 3.7 million people spoiled their ballots.\n Continue reading...",

Conservative MP Robert Halfon and his colleagues think that “white working-class” pupils have fallen behind because of the use of terms such as “white privilege”. They suggest that there is an “industry” benefiting non-white people. This is a ludicrous culture war stunt to whip up animosity without addressing real and growing problems of inequality and disadvantage.\nIn Mr Halfon’s world, the “white working class” is the victim of unfair racial competition in which it is outperformed by other minority ethnic groups. The framing is incendiary, and, as the report admits, the data is ropey. Eligibility for free school meals is a crude proxy for disadvantage. The support goes to children with parents who are not usually working; or are not employed more than 16 hours a week; or have very low incomes. How can Mr Halfon make claims about the “white working class” when he is in fact talking about the poorest 13% of the total white cohort in English secondary schools?\n Continue reading...",

In Denmark (population around 5.5 million), there are around 200,000 summer houses. These cannot be used as year-round residences or bought by non-Danes without permission from the government.\nThis means that on a popular holiday island like Bornholm, local people can still afford homes because they live in houses classified as permanent residences, while Copenhageners, for instance, buy sensitively constructed holiday houses in peaceful wooded compounds that are controlled by strict planning laws.

The one in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, which has taken place for more than 30 years, centres on a “town trail” of more than 130 artists in 100 residents’ homes and public spaces, as well as curated exhibitions, performance, music, food stalls etc. As with a music festival, it takes us many months to put together, but again this year we will not be able to welcome the 5,000 people who used to visit the town on a September weekend. One of the reasons is worry about Covid-19 being passed on in people’s homes, but insurance is also a big factor.

Should cinephiles be worried?\nDid another citadel just fall? Has another general just presented his sword in surrender? Steven Spielberg’s production company Amblin has signed a deal to produce multiple features a year for the streaming behemoth Netflix – which is precisely that small-screen player that Spielberg seemed to be rebuking two years ago when he proclaimed the importance of the theatrical experience and implied digital streaming content should not be eligible for Oscars. (Spielberg has since disputed the way his words were reported and interpreted.)\nWell, now Spielberg has joined that other celluloid master, Martin Scorsese, in taking the Netflix dollar. Of course, this is not an exclusive deal: Amblin still has relationships with other studios, including Universal, and its own producing remit, after all, is for both film and television. It is also the case that Spielberg himself, though credited as a producer on them all, may not actually direct any of the films that are earmarked for Netflix. But it is still a mighty name for Netflix to have in the bag, and his prestige and the attendant coverage are still hugely important for the big streaming service, which is hyper-vigilant in its guarding against any slowing of momentum in subscription growth. We are, arguably, another step closer to the theatrical experience being just another aspect of the content rollout – a luxury loss-leader or promotional event, perhaps, while the main action involves consuming movies on laptops, tablets and even phones. Or are we approaching a postmodern cinema, which is a new version of its nickelodeon beginnings: watching flickering images once again on a tiny screen?\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Fallen from power, he is showing great promise as a poster – and we can’t get enough of his online revelations\nJust thinking back on the bizarre fever dream of last summer, when Dominic Cummings drove to Barnard Castle and became the most hated man in Britain. Remember that? When he did the little press conference over a trestle table? It feels strange to look back on that moment of British culture now. Because we were all there, we were all involved. We were all doing very bizarre things in lockdowns one, two and three – downloading the Houseparty app, for instance – and for a hot week, being transcendentally angry at Dominic Cummings was one of them. We’ll have to explain this to our children, one day. “Well, it was 2020 and nobody really knew if it was legal to leave the house or not,” we’ll say. “The isolation was doing very strange things to all our heads. Dominic Cummings – a very bald man who loved bluebells and had a blog 15 years after anyone else in the universe did – worked for the government and we were all very angry at him. No, I don’t remember precisely why.”\nAnyway, he’s back. I feel like this will be a biweekly occurrence until I die now, actually: Dominic Cummings “coming back”, either by dropping a blogpost or doing a tweet or appearing in front of a hearing or bullying Matt Hancock so hard he has to meekly tell assembled press through a union jack face mask that he doesn’t think he’s hopeless. Cummings’ latest back-coming move was to drop WhatsApp screenshots of Boris Johnson at the start of a pandemic – and nothing soothes the soul quite like knowing the prime minister of the country, a man who messes his own hair up for photo opportunities because it’s the only thing that takes the burn off his palpable Eton-ness, actually responded to a pandemic with a panicked “Wtf?” at 10.18pm. \n Continue reading...",

Believers may well be swept away by this glossy account of the 1917 Miracle of the Sun in Fátima, Portugal – witnessed by 30,000 people and already the subject of feature films in 1952 and 2009. But given the inherent lack of drama in the kind of unbreakable faith on display here, anyone wishing to tell the story needs to work much harder than this laboured treatment to wring any nuance, conflict or indeed true sublimity from it.\nTo be fair, director Marco Pontecorvo – son of The Battle of Algiers’ Gillo – doesn’t disgrace himself on the latter front. There’s an undeniable sacred frisson as Mediterreanean winds caress the olive trees and invisible feet flatten the saltgrass, as the Virgin Mary first visits three young shepherds Lúcia, Jacinta and Francisco, and anoints them as her messengers. The trio quickly attract followers among a war-weary populace eager for deliverance. But others think Lucia (Stephanie Gil) is just seeking attention, including the rational-minded mayor, eager to get a public order nightmare under control, and her own devout mother Maria Rosa (Lúcia Moniz), worried her daughter’s presumptuousness will anger Him upstairs.\n Continue reading...",

Not in the football, you understand – putting four third-place teams through simply further deflates the group stages of an already format-compromised 24-team tournament. But threatening last week to take the final away from Wembley and move it to Hungary unless 2,500 of their dignitaries can swerve quarantine – well, this is the stuff of which perilous thrills are made.\nNot that a Budapest final wouldn’t offer something fresh: large numbers of openly racist and homophobic fans who are finally under investigation by Uefa for their conduct thus far during the tournament. The governing body has sensationally abandoned its high-level probe into German captain Manuel Neuer’s decision to wear a rainbow armband, and seems to be belatedly taking a look at “potential discriminatory incidents” at Hungary games against both Portugal and France . Honestly, you don’t get into football policing for that, do you?

Just ask Mischa Barton. It is 15 years since she starred as Marissa Cooper in the teen drama The OC, and yet still she can’t shake her off. When Barton appeared in the reality show The Hills in 2019 – inspired by The OC’s privileged young Californians but featuring real-life people – she was supposed to be herself, but the producers expected Cooper. “It is the constant mistake,” she says wryly. “They were even calling me by my character name. Seriously? Like, this far down the line they can’t get my name right?”\nThe parallels, though, are irresistible. Marissa was a troubled party girl with a love of fashion who met a tragic end. Mischa (even their names are similar) was also a troubled party girl with a love of fashion, whose life at times seemed out of control. There was the extreme fame, the breakdown, the reported threats of suicide, estrangement from her parents and a “revenge porn” court case.

From the Lost City of Z to El Dorado, a thirst for finding ancient civilisations and their treasures in perilous tropical forest settings has driven innumerable ill-fated expeditions. This obsession has seeped into western societies’ popular ideas of tropical forest cities, with overgrown ruins acting as the backdrop for fear, discovery and life-threatening challenges in countless films, novels and video games.\nThroughout these depictions runs the idea that all ancient cities and states in tropical forests were doomed to fail. That the most resilient occupants of tropical forests are small villages of poison dart-blowing hunter-gatherers. And that vicious vines and towering trees – or, in the case of The Jungle Book, a boisterous army of monkeys – will inevitably claw any significant human achievement back into the suffocating green whence it came. This idea has been boosted by books and films that focus on the collapse of particularly enigmatic societies such as the Classic Maya. The decaying stone walls, the empty grand structures and the deserted streets of these tropical urban leftovers act as a tragic warning that our own way of life is not as secure as we would like to assume.\n Continue reading...",

Liam Rosenior and Paul MacInnes reflect on how football became enmeshed in the culture wars\nWhen England’s footballers took to the pitch for their first match of Euro 2020 last Sunday they felt the weight of expectation as one of the tournament’s hotly tipped sides. But after a loudly bellowed national anthem, the team dropped to one knee on the Wembley turf for the anti-racism act that has become a mainstay of English football for the past year. Some of their own supporters loudly booed before the majority drowned them out in applause. \nLiam Rosenior, a former professional footballer currently on the coaching staff at Derby County, tells Anushka Asthana of his sadness but not surprise at the booing. He takes apart the argument that the players are making an overtly political statement and chastises politicians who he believes have sought to use the issue to inflame existing tensions. The Guardian’s sports reporter Paul MacInnes delves into the history of the gesture itself, which gained traction in the US on the back of the long-running anti-racism protest made by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. \n Continue reading...",
