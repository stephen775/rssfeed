Alisson put an error-riddled season behind him with last week’s glorious header. Trent Alexander-Arnold returned to the form that marks him out as a captain-in-waiting.

Before a global pandemic irrevocably changed the fashion industry, live events and just about everything else, the week’s organisers had already announced a significant shift: the public would be able to buy tickets to what was previously a trade-only event.\nLast year’s shows did not go on, but IMG, the global events company that runs Australian fashion week, is optimistic about the 2021 edition. Barring public health emergencies, the event will begin on 31 May.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Turkey is the latest country to reject the role of world’s dustbin. With their environment bill, ministers have a chance to end this vandalism\nThe international plastics recycling market is broken. It is doubtful whether it ever worked. For most of the last decade, China was the world’s largest importer of recyclable materials, some of which were used in manufacturing. But it banned these imports as part of a “beautiful China” policy aimed at improving the environment.\nMalaysia was the next country to fight back against being treated as the “dumping ground of the world” – as its environment minister, Yeo Bee Yin, put it in 2019. More than 200 facilities were closed, and thousands of tonnes of waste returned, amid growing evidence of the involvement of organised crime in the global waste business. Now Turkey has rejected the role of international rubbish bin: after a Greenpeace investigation found plastics dumped in rivers, on beaches and in illegal waste mountains, it announced that most plastic waste imports (which included 209,642 tonnes from the UK in 2020) will be banned in six weeks’ time.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Access to local hubs plays a vital role in maintaining health and tackling inequalities. They must not be allowed to close \nOne of the many discoveries of the last 14 months has been how Covid-19 seeks out underlying vulnerabilities. These are as plural and complex as the people they afflict. But one vulnerability the government has, rightly, pinpointed as something to be addressed is obesity. In 2019, the year leading into the pandemic, figures for England showed over a million hospital admissions for causes directly related to obesity, with 67% of men and 60% of women overweight or obese. Months of lockdown are not likely to have improved this. Boris Johnson, recognising that his weight may have contributed to his hospitalisation with Covid-19, has been banging the drum on the need to achieve a healthy weight; and the government is promoting “weight management services”.\nIt is a pity, then, that the means so far made available to local communities do not support the laudable end. Earlier this month, the former Paralympian Lady Grey-Thompson told Mr Johnson that more than 50% of public leisure facilities are at risk of closing in the next six months. The next day, the District Councils’ Network (DCN), which represents 180 district councils providing leisure services in England, noted that one in three councils expected to close leisure centres for good in the next three months, and over half in the next year. Of those able to remain open, 80% expected to decrease services. The government will point to its recent grant of £100m for leisure centres and a £18,000 restart sum for individual gyms – but the DCN survey was conducted after the awarding of this grant. A funding gap of £325m remains.\n Continue reading...",

She examines the groups and individuals bingeing on criticisms of the BBC and Martin Bashir. She calls them out for the self-serving hypocrites they are when they denounce those involved in the securing and broadcasting of the interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. At that time, the prime emotion emanating from most of them was envy that Bashir and the BBC had “scooped” such a prize. Hyde persuasively draws attention to the guilt we all share, some with greater awareness and acceptance than others. \nBut in all of this discussion and polemics, let us remember that the sentiments expressed by Diana in that interview were relevant and understandable. She had, since the early days of her marriage, been subjected to duplicity and betrayal by those closest to her. Let us not forget the contribution to her alleged paranoia made by the Prince of Wales and his current wife (then Camilla Parker Bowles). Diana’s isolation and marginalisation had become unsustainable – she needed to both complain and explain. The BBC and Bashir provided the platform. They should not be pilloried by individuals (certainly not by those such as our exceedingly mendacious prime minister), nor indeed by those in the media whose record in this affair is dubious.\n Continue reading...",

Each Saturday, Radio 1 aired a series titled 25 Years of Rock, based on news and music spanning the years 1955 to 1979. And that week, in among archive clips of Lyndon Johnson, Harold Wilson, the Vietnam war and whatever else had happened in 1965, there was the sudden whip-crack of a snare drum followed by six minutes of music unlike anything I had ever heard: a great cascading noise, led by a voice that, as the US composer Michael Pisaro later wrote, somehow managed to be simultaneously “compassionate, tragic … vengeful, gleeful, ironic, weary, spectral, [and] haranguing”.\nI soon found out that what I had experienced was Dylan’s watershed single Like a Rolling Stone, whose lyric is ostensibly addressed to some unnamed wealthy socialite as she is suddenly cut off from money and privilege. But as a matter of instinct, what I still hear in that song is a message from someone in the midst of early adulthood about how to live at that time of life. The best way to be when young, Dylan seems to insist, is restless, light on baggage, and scornful of any conventions or rules – reconciled, as Like a Rolling Stone famously puts it, to having no direction home.\n Continue reading...",

She brings herself sufficiently alive to turn a confusion of impressions into a fusion of trends, from which she can distill the essential essence of the coming season.” The namedropping of glamorous destinations, while simultaneously giving the impression that covering the shows is war-zone-level challenging, the dash of performative ennui, and the obligatory twist of champagne: this is what being a fashion editor was and is, then and now.

Whitley’s thematic ideas are sometimes as under the radar as a social media megacorp quietly sucking up your personal details. What’s dominant here is a hypnotic light installation by the Dutch artists Children of the Light, an LED strip that continually transforms, from glowing amber lightsaber to flaming javelin to shooting stars. It rotates above the stage, distracting our attention from the humans below, who frequently fade into the darkness and thick haze.

But something stymies the pleasure of these images: namely, the method of their making.\nIn late 2019, at the age of 82, David Hockney moved to a timbered house in rural Normandy to observe the arrival of spring. He had already depicted the season’s wild beauty in his native Yorkshire with the magnificent charcoal drawings of 2014. Now he uses an iPad and stylus to make daily paintings of his French surroundings.

Thanks to the constant, freakishly rapid copying of designer brands, the cross-pollination of trends between risk-averse, competing outlets and the tendency for umbrella companies to open sister shops that have an almost indistinguishable ethos to the original outlet, the world of high-street fashion has been derivative and uninspiring for years.

Warned that his colleagues in both the Polish intelligence service and the KGB were on to him, Michal Goleniewski spent days crisscrossing the city, desperately trying to evade their surveillance for long enough to reach the US consulate – and defect to the west.\nThe day he managed it proved to be one of the most important of the cold war, a new book published later this month will argue.

In 1996 it became home to the photographer Al J Thompson, who moved from Jamaica at the age of 16 to join his mother who had settled there. At the time, Spring Valley had, in Thompson’s memory, a thriving and vibrant African-Caribbean community, centred around Spring Valley Memorial Park, where there would be jerk chicken cook-outs and long games of cricket at weekends, and kids his age would play football until it was dark.\nBack then, there were big plans to develop the land around the park with new social housing projects, building on the community that lived there, tackling some of the social problems that existed. In the years that followed, however, the social housing did not get built, the land around the park was sold to developers for private condominiums, and the familiar patterns of gentrification followed. The mom-and-pop stores on Main Street were taken over by chains, the kids who dreamed of opening music studios never raised the money. Families like Thompson’s – two-thirds of Spring Valley’s community had been black – were priced out and moved even further towards the city’s margins. By the time he returned to Spring Valley in 2017, African-Caribbean numbers had halved, there were no cricket matches or cook-outs, and the old faces he saw in the park had a more hopeless look.\n Continue reading...",

Rio’s favelas have suffered countless horrors since the drug conflict began to intensify in the mid-1980s and cocaine and war-grade weapons began flooding communities such as Jacarezinho.
