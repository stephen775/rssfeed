          "description": "National Theatre, London\nLyndsey Turner’s production is a charming albeit emotionally distanced retreat into nostalgia\nDylan Thomas’s drama, broadcast on radio in 1954 , has been recited by pre-eminent Welsh voices from Thomas himself to Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins. Now Michael Sheen gives us this day in the life of Llareggub, Thomas’s fictitious seaside village in Wales. It is hard to go wrong with this tour de force of oral poetry which oozes word pictures and onomatopoeic musicality. Lyndsey Turner’s production does it justice, accentuating the earthy comedy and romanticism of intimately lived village life. It tries to capture Thomas’s pace too: gorgeous linguistic sprints that turn to a quiet maudlin ambling.\nSheen – shaggy, bearded and full of humanity – leads as the narrator but this is really an ensemble show, animated with amusing turns by Siân Phillips, Cleo Sylvestre and Ifan Huw Dafydd among others. It comes with an inventive framing device (additional material is written by Siân Owen) in which Sheen plays the son of Richard Jenkins (Karl Johnson), who is losing his bearings when he is visited by Jenkins Junior in his nursing home. Thomas’s narrative is used to jog Jenkins’s memory and bring him back to the present moment, and to his son. The father-son relationship contains powerful undercurrents of tension and unspoken history, and is movingly performed by both actors.\n Continue reading...",

The consumer healthcare division will depart via a plain-vanilla demerger next year; shareholders will have to live with a sharply reduced dividend; and “new GSK” will seek salvation for its rotten share price by investing more heavily in its core business of pharmaceuticals and vaccines.\nThat’s the outline of the changes, but the edges went a little blurry on close inspection.

The first time I admitted this in public I was worried I would get kicked out of the feminist club, but I discovered that many, many, many women have left a march at half-time. Some quite famous feminists have told me they have snuck off to the pub for a cheeky half, planning to go back out, and woken up with a hangover. Still, I have to think that going to a protest, being counted and raising your voice is, like many things in life, better than not going at all – even if you get overwhelmed by the crowd and don’t quite make it to the finish line.\nThe British have a reputation for being quiet and polite but there’s a long tradition of us being noisy and annoying. It is how we got everything we treasure, from votes for people who aren’t posh landowners to gay weddings. We even protested to get two days off a week and invented the weekend. We have saved libraries, protested both for and against Brexit, and last summer overturned dodgy exam algorithms. We ended the European Super League before it began.

It cannot be deployed later in the year if voters feel bad about something else.

While it may be a fool’s errand to try to interpret the voice of the people when the vast majority preferred to remain silent, Sunday’s voting has changed the conversation about what lies ahead.\nVoters were asked to choose the representatives who will govern France’s 18 regions (13 domestic and five overseas).

This innovative approach to messaging has attracted some attention for its lack of memorable policies (remember “British Recovery Bonds”?). But its main feature has been the unconventional insistence, from Starmer and his top team, that voters are right to shun Labour, who deserve to lose, in favour of the Tories, who are frankly doing such an excellent job that they will naturally keep winning.\nThe seeds of this approach were first sown by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in the aftermath of the 2019 election defeat, when he said the British public got it right by voting Tory. The baton was soon picked up by the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, who was keen to stress in her leadership campaign that Labour must “change or die”.\n Continue reading...",

We have a relatively healthy sex life but he does not reciprocate with oral sex. When confronted, he said he has no issue surrounding it, he just feels it is not necessary. I feel rejected and that the focus is primarily on him reaching an orgasm, with no focus on my enjoyment. How can I have a conversation with him without him getting defensive? I have never had an orgasm through penetrative sex and, in previous relationships, I have loved receiving oral sex.\nYour husband needs to be educated regarding your precise needs and the nature of female arousal and orgasm in general. It seems as if you have been extremely patient and accommodating until now, so it is probably no wonder he sees no reason to change his style. And he may be afraid he will not know exactly what to do, so you will have to help him by being very specific about what feels good. Try to frame your request for oral pleasuring in a highly seductive, playful manner – so that he realises he will be rewarded for his efforts. Once he learns that your arousal is a great turn on for him, he will be more motivated to complete the task.\n Continue reading...",

The British biologist and director of the charity Project Vesta wants to turn a trillion tonnes of CO2 into rock, and sink it to the bottom of the sea.\nGreen admits the idea is “audacious”. It would involve locking away atmospheric carbon by dropping pea-coloured sand into the ocean. The sand is made of ground olivine – an abundant volcanic rock, known to jewellers as peridot – and, if Green’s calculations are correct, depositing it offshore on 2% of the world’s coastlines would capture 100% of total global annual carbon emissions.\n Continue reading...",

Harambe’s at the top of the hill, waiting to meet you there.”\nMcCurry took the photograph of the 17-year-old western lowland gorilla that went on to become a meme. In it, Harambe kneels, projecting a fearsome aura of strength, nobility and calm. A former volunteer photographer at Cincinnati zoo, McCurry was there on 28 May 2016, the fateful day a three-year-old boy climbed into the gorilla’s enclosure, forcing zookeepers to shoot Harambe dead. “It didn’t seem real at first,” says McCurry, who was a regular visitor to the zoo. “When any of your friends die, it’s hard to process.
