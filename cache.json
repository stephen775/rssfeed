But it could make its white characters squirm a bit more\n\nThe third season of Motherland starts as it means to go on: with an “absolute nitshow”. As an official arrives to brief parents at the state primary school, every unravelling mother in the land will wish she didn’t recognise herself. The nit expert urges parents to comply with the guidelines: “Combing … shampooing … combing again,” which is only marginally less laughable than the government’s “stay alert” slogan it is satirising. But it is not too soon for the pandemic to get the Motherland treatment – if it came in a bottle, it would look, smell and perform precisely like nit shampoo.\nFive taut, hilarious and occasionally problematic episodes later, Motherland ends with something less expected – an appearance by Paul, Julia’s perennially absent husband. It is a love scene of sorts, if by love scene you mean a husband and wife who can barely stand each other going to the pub. Partners who are missing in action are a cruel running joke in Motherland. Their absence is part of what makes the mums (plus Kevin) so unhinged, lonely and embittered. This season also includes Kevin’s never-before-seen wife, Jill, constantly disappearing up the loft ladder “like a chinchilla” before asking for a divorce. Never mind, says Kevin. “Intimacy takes many forms, like listening to Radio 4 together while I scrub the hob.” Ha. Also, sob.\n Continue reading...",

It’s almost become a cottage industry worthy of its own separate BBC channel.\nSo once the BBC stops making programmes examining its own failings, it might be surprised to find out that most MPs seem to have a higher opinion of the BBC than the BBC has of itself. Which isn’t to say they are blind to its failings. Indeed in his answer to an urgent question from Julian Knight, chair of the culture select committee, the junior culture minister John Whittingdale was at pains to spell out just how far the BBC had fallen below the standards expected of it in the way the Diana interview had been obtained, along with the subsequent cover-up and reappointment of Bashir in 2016.\n Continue reading...",

The European Cup is heavy, but the Uefa Cup? Woah. A seriously big chunk of steel.”\nOn Wednesday Villarreal face Manchester United in Gdansk. It is their first European final; it is Moreno’s fifth in seven years. It is his third in this competition alone, and with three different clubs. “I was at Sevilla and we reached a Europa League final, went to Liverpool and we reached a Europa League final, came to Villarreal and we reached a Europa League final. The next team I join, I’m putting that in the contract,” he says, grinning as he mimes signing a deal.\n Continue reading...",

But what is marked is the power of female friendship and loyalty. In both dramas, girls have a fierce sisterliness and a strong sense of agency, even within the greater fearfulness of their lives.\nThis is more vividly displayed in Blis-ta (★★★★☆), a Clean Break drama written by the late Sonya Hale. Ambreen Razia, as Kat, and Ria Zmitrowicz, as Cherry, reflect the helter-skelter energy and passion of Hale’s lyrical script, which is written in urban patois and seems to relish the rhythmic beauty of words.\n Continue reading...",

The west’s response must be swift and robust\nIn recent months, Europe has watched impotently from the sidelines as Alexander Lukashenko brutally reasserted his illegitimate authority over the population of Belarus. The protest movement that threatened the survival of his regime after fraudulent 2020 elections has, for the time being, been subjugated: a combination of state violence, media suppression, incarceration and torture has battered a people into temporary submission. The modest sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States have had limited effect, while deepening the dependency of “Europe’s last dictator” on Vladimir Putin’s largesse and goodwill.\nCalibrating a response to state repression that will not play into Mr Putin’s hands has not been easy. But for the EU in particular, Monday’s extraordinary abduction of Roman Protasevich, an opposition journalist based in Lithuania, must be the catalyst for a stepchange in strategy. Along with his girlfriend, Mr Protasevich was abducted from Ryanair flight FR4978, which was crossing Belarusian airspace while flying from Athens to Vilnius. It appears he was followed onto the commercial flight by members of the Belarusian KGB. Passengers have reported Mr Protasevich’s panic and terror as the flight was diverted to Minsk on spurious grounds, accompanied by a MiG-29 fighter jet. The opposition movement’s main figurehead, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has said that he may face the death penalty.\n Continue reading...",

But there’s not much humour in being friendless\nIt was a year of records for Eurovision, filmed in front of a reduced live audience in Rotterdam after last year’s event was cancelled. Eden Alene from Israel sang the competition’s highest-ever note. A model moon measuring six metres across and suspended above Spain’s entry was said to be the biggest-ever prop. Also on Saturday, the UK became the first nation to receive the dreaded nul points under a new voting system introduced in 2016, where the splitting of votes between juries and viewers was thought to make it almost impossible for a song to plumb such depths of unpopularity. Ooh la la, as the French contestant Barbara Pravi (one of a minority of competitors to sing in a language other than English) might have said.\nMs Pravi came second behind Italy’s Måneskin, a band that was caught up in another drama. Damiano David, the singer for the triumphant Roman rockers, agreed to take a drug test after he was caught on camera appearing to snort something off a table. The test having come back negative, his band kept their title. Down at the bottom of the scoreboard, there was even less room for manoeuvre. Britain’s James Newman took the rejection of his lacklustre tune, Embers, with good grace. In a contest that revels in being over the top, there is perhaps something fitting about such a spectacular defeat.\n Continue reading...",

The Kent all-rounder’s extraordinary innings of 190 against Glamorgan last Friday created a very modern sort of buzz, one that has really been possible only in recent years. For decades, an innings like Stevens’s would have existed largely in the imagination: a blur of numbers on a screen and two columns in the newspaper, rather than an actual lived memory. Now, via social media and the miracle of the YouTube livestream – hey, psst, stop what you’re doing and watch this – it can live in plain sight.\nAnd what an innings it was: remarkable not so much for its technical excellence (he was dropped three times) but for its sheer, sleeves-up, bollocks-to-you audacity. Michael Neser, a 90mph Australian international seamer, is smashed over his head.

There used to be a simple maxim that the reason for involving the private sector in public services was to transfer risk. Taking risks was something the private sector was supposed to be good at. It targets investments to make the service attractive. It then sells that service to maximise profits. Getting the decisions right is the difficult thing – that is the risk it takes. To do this, it needs to be allowed to make key decisions, such as how big the service is and how often it will run, to match how many it believes it can sell. The more it sells, the better the profits. Simple.\nBut the new Great British Railways model takes these risks away from the private sector. The “how big” and “how often” decisions will be taken by the government. The private companies will just get paid for running the trains. The only variable in the private sector’s control will be costs. The decision, therefore, will no longer be “how many do we sell?”, as that will be fixed by the government, but “how do we deliver this more cheaply?”. To maximise profits, the companies will have just one aim: to reduce costs. And we are to believe Grant Shapps when he says that this will result in a better service?\nShaun Soper\nMidhurst, West Sussex\n Continue reading...",

We go behind the scenes at a new show exploding myths about the ancient world’s favourite baddie\nNero comes with a lurid reputation. “The main thing we know about him is his infamy,” says Thorsten Opper, curator of the first British exhibition devoted to the Roman emperor. “The glutton, the profligate, the matricide, the megalomaniac.” Also, the pyromaniac: famously, Nero “fiddled while Rome burned”, or at least strummed his kithara to one of his own compositions, The Fall of Troy, while a fire, supposedly begun by him, destroyed three of Rome’s 14 districts and seriously damaged seven.\nHis afterlife on the page and screen is certainly arresting. Nero inspired some of the greatest Renaissance and baroque operas, notably Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea and Handel’s Agrippina, which chart the emperor’s adulterous love for Poppaea, who became his second wife. In the epic 1951 movie Quo Vadis, Peter Ustinov played Nero as entirely unhinged: a mincing, purple-swathed toddler in a man’s body. Christopher Biggins took him on in I, Claudius, the classic BBC adaptation of Robert Graves’s novel, and made him power-hungry, baby-faced and quite, quite mad.\n Continue reading...",

Here’s why this healthy, sustainable food should be on everyone’s shopping list\nIt may be an issue with branding, concedes Roxana Jullapat. Sorghum sounds odd – and not especially delicious. “I do wonder: why did quinoa get a chance and sorghum didn’t?” says Jullapat, who runs the Los Angeles bakery Friends & Family. She is also the author of Mother Grains: Recipes for the Grain Revolution. It is a cookbook, but also a love letter to whole grains and a manifesto for weaning people off wheat. Although Jullapat covers other “ancient” grains – including rye, oat and barley – in the book, sorghum is probably the least familiar to most readers in the UK.\nOriginating in Africa, where it is eaten widely, sorghum made its way to the southern US, probably with enslaved people. Later, it became an important crop – particularly for the sweet sorghum molasses made from it – to African American families in the south; the culinary historian Michael W Twitty has talked about reclaiming sorghum. It is popular in the Middle East and east Asia, too. It is a very weather-resistant crop and can be grown in a densely populated way, which makes it valuable in terms of food security.\n Continue reading...",

The woman behind the hospital check-in desk asked for my next of kin. Suddenly, I realised I had no name to give her.

I blinked back tears as I sent a message to a group of friends asking whether it was OK for me to give one of their contact details.\nThis wasn’t just any group of friends. As my mum was being prepped for her risky transplant a couple of months before, I had the bleak realisation that I might soon be very alone in the world.

The next morning her neighbour, whom she had asked to keep an eye on the house, would call to tell her his CCTV had captured a man hanging around outside her house at 4am.

In 1996 it became home to the photographer Al J Thompson, who moved from Jamaica at the age of 16 to join his mother who had settled there. At the time, Spring Valley had, in Thompson’s memory, a thriving and vibrant African-Caribbean community, centred around Spring Valley Memorial Park, where there would be jerk chicken cook-outs and long games of cricket at weekends, and kids his age would play football until it was dark.\nBack then, there were big plans to develop the land around the park with new social housing projects, building on the community that lived there, tackling some of the social problems that existed. In the years that followed, however, the social housing did not get built, the land around the park was sold to developers for private condominiums, and the familiar patterns of gentrification followed. The mom-and-pop stores on Main Street were taken over by chains, the kids who dreamed of opening music studios never raised the money. Families like Thompson’s – two-thirds of Spring Valley’s community had been black – were priced out and moved even further towards the city’s margins. By the time he returned to Spring Valley in 2017, African-Caribbean numbers had halved, there were no cricket matches or cook-outs, and the old faces he saw in the park had a more hopeless look.\n Continue reading...",
