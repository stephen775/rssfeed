To most, the decision came out of a clear blue sky.\nThe government has dumped visitors from the UK with a difficult choice. They can scramble home before the Tuesday deadline – rebooking flights, and the necessary Covid tests. Or they can remain in Portugal and accept that they will have to quarantine when they return. Disruption for those about to fly out, and who have now had to cancel, is almost as bad. It is a rubbish way to treat citizens.

As you read this, it may already be unravelling. But a new government has been formed in Israel, thereby removing the man who has ruled that country longer than anyone else. Benjamin Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past quarter-century: first elected as prime minister in 1996, he has ruled Israel uninterrupted for the past 12 years. But now, if the new coalition holds together – a big if – the reign of Bibi, King of Israel, will come to an end. Even if we should have no illusions about what comes next, that itself is a cause for celebration.\nIt is also the new government’s sole, animating purpose. The motley collection of parties, which runs from the settler hard right through the centre to the liberal left – and which includes a Palestinian Islamist party – has next to nothing else in common. It cannot be described as hawkish or dove-ish, left or right: it is simply the anti-Netanyahu bloc, forged to prise his fingers off the prime ministerial desk once and for all.\n Continue reading...",

As the numbers opposed became clearer, the government has been trying to dodge a vote on the matter.

I wonder if there might be a conversation to be had\nI love my mother most of the time, but sometimes I hate her. She has always been critical of me; it’s as if she has to find fault (with my hair, my clothes, the way I do things). My brother is spared this criticism.\nMy mum is in her late 70s, and unlikely to change. It’s never worth arguing with her – especially now, as she is grieving and vulnerable following the death of my father last year. I suppress my anger, keep quiet and change the subject. I call and visit often, as I now have to help her with legal and financial affairs; my brother lives abroad and this isn’t his skill set. Mum lives in a different part of the country from me, and it’s not practical to go just for the day, so I am very much on her turf when I visit; if I don’t do things the way she wants, there is an explosion. She then seems to recognise that she has gone over the top and sends sweet emails a day or two later about how capable I am.\n Continue reading...",

Or, perhaps more accurately, not have a mental block about drinking the stuff. As with full-strength craft beers, there’s now enough booze-free choice out there to engage almost anyone who loves flavour, whether or not they identify as a beer drinker.\nBut why is alcohol-free beer so successful, especially when no-alcohol wine isn’t? The main reason is that the two main flavouring ingredients of beer, malt and hops, are still present, while brewers can, and do, add other ingredients to flavour their beers (cocoa nibs to porter, for example). Plus, it’s lower in alcohol to start with than wine, so there isn’t so much ground to make up.\n Continue reading...",

I was never going to settle for rolling up a shirt sleeve when I had a great excuse to wear a Studio 54-esque one‑shoulder number on a weekday morning.\nThe vaccine top is the new Zoom collar, except with added feelgood factor. Like the Zoom collar, it is fashion that has been art-directed by the pandemic, rather than by the catwalk. It is practical (the naked shoulder offers easy access to prime arm real estate, saving you from the indignity of trying to squeeze your arm through a tight sleeve, which can be surprisingly difficult) but it is also a way of honouring the moment.

Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme, dermatologist and founder of Adonia Medical Clinic, says: “Damage to the skin by free radical or reactive oxygen species can include hyperpigmentation, prominent appearance of pores, dull-looking skin and eventually fine lines and premature ageing.”\nThese skin stressors, combined with the added dermatological strain after months of life in lockdown – being indoors with the central heating on, anxiety and lack of sleep – can also leave the skin looking dull and prone to blemishes. A good night’s rest, meditation, a balanced diet and regular exercise can all help with internalised stress and anxiety, but what about the effects of pollution on the skin?\n Continue reading...",
