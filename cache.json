Wolf Hall it is not\n\nIf it’s pigs heads on platters, it must be Tudors. And so it is. 1536, to be precise. Opening captions for the new Channel 5 drama Anne Boleyn, stripped across three nights, inform us that Anne has been queen for two and half years, has provided Henry VIII with one daughter, had two miscarriages and is now pregnant again. She is the most powerful woman in England, and she has just five months to live. Dum-dum-DAH!\nI added the dum-dum-DAH! Anne Boleyn (the drama) takes itself too seriously for that. This is not The Tudors, this is Proper History and it delivers on all the basics. The caprice of Henry (Mark Stanley). The claustrophobia of court. The power of a misplaced word or a deliberate strike. The power struggles between Cromwell (Barry Ward) and Anne (Jodie Turner-Smith). The quiet progress of the “little mouse” Jane Seymour (Lola Petticrew). The importance of an heir. The horse-trading between countries to secure alliances, and the seven-dimensional chess being played behind the scenes.\n Continue reading...",

Truly, the life of a touring standup is not all glamour. That’s partly the point that Half My Life is making: it finds the New Jersey man revisiting a handful of his favourite venues, ruminating on life as a mid-career comedian, and pining for his wife and baby son back home. Between the scenes of this diary-cum-documentary, footage is spliced from the shows on the tour.\nIt’s a diverting behind-the-scenes document of the peripatetic comic’s life – if not a particularly surprising one. We see Gethard and support act Carmen Christopher gridlocked on the interstate under lowering clouds, electric-scootering around Asbury Park, New Jersey, in the hours before showtime – then post-gig, posing for photos by the merch stall. None of it looks like the big time; Gethard jokes that he couldn’t fill an arena if he tried. But then, he began life as a tyro punk comic, and if Half My Life conjures with Gethard’s career disillusion, it also advertises his fidelity to those roots.\n Continue reading...",

By vowing that he would do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro from aggressive speculation by bond markets, Mr Draghi eased the pressure and defused a crisis that, left unchecked, posed an existential threat to the European Union.\nThe spirit of “whatever it takes” is required this summer from richer nations, if a durable and morally just exit from the Covid-19 pandemic is to take place. As G7 leaders prepare to meet in Cornwall next weekend, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has called on Boris Johnson to match each vaccine administered in Britain with a donated dose to developing nations, where there is a desperate shortage. In a joint plea, the heads of the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization have warned that the gulf in levels of vaccination is creating a “two-track pandemic”.

          "description": "International courts say the archipelago belongs to Mauritius, not the UK. What is Britain waiting for?\n\nBritain’s forced eviction of up to 2,000 Chagos Islanders from their homes on the Indian Ocean archipelago, to make way for a huge US military base on Diego Garcia, was shameful – by the admission of the UK government itself. But if the last half century has made it more willing to acknowledge its original sin, it has come no closer to addressing it seriously. The only noticeable progress in recent years was the creation of a £40m fund for the displaced islanders, of which only a tiny fraction has been spent.\nMeanwhile, international opinion is inexorably moving against the UK. Last month, the council of the UN’s Universal Postal Union recommended that stamps issued by the British Indian Ocean Territory – as the UK designates the islands – should not be recognised. What on its own sounds trivial reflects the overwhelming shift to recognition of the archipelago as belonging to Mauritius, from which it was severed when the country gained independence in the 1960s, in exchange for a £4m payment. (Mauritius says it was coerced.) United Nations maps have already been redrawn. Little by little, legal decisions are having their effect.\n Continue reading...",

Pope John Paul II refused us permission to be married in church. Is it that Boris Johnson always gets what he wants, or is it that the church’s rules defy any rational logic, or is it perhaps both?\nChris Larkman\nLondon\n• Twenty-eight years ago, my wife and I were refused a blessing in a Catholic church in Bournemouth on the grounds that I was divorced. My first marriage took place in a register office, but there was no mention of an exemption being made on the grounds that this was not a Catholic ceremony. However, as I had no children from my first marriage, the priest asked if my first wife had refused to have children, as this might be grounds for an annulment. Obviously, this could not be applied to Boris Johnson, given his fecundity. We thought it would not be a good way to start a new relationship if it were to be based on a lie, and so we declined the “offer”.\nPhilip and Tina Wragg\nCampillos, Málaga, Spain\n Continue reading...",

While watching this happen, I have started to think we are witnessing an outbreak of disaster patriarchy.\nNaomi Klein was the first to identify “disaster capitalism”, when capitalists use a disaster to impose measures they couldn’t possibly get away with in normal times, generating more profit for themselves. Disaster patriarchy is a parallel and complementary process, where men exploit a crisis to reassert control and dominance, and rapidly erase hard-earned women’s rights. All over the world, patriarchy has taken full advantage of the virus to reclaim power – on the one hand, escalating the danger and violence to women, and on the other, stepping in as their supposed controller and protector.\n Continue reading...",

From Cecil Rhodes to Rosa Parks, let’s get rid of them all\n\nHaving been a black leftwing Guardian columnist for more than two decades, I understood that I would be regarded as fair game for the kind of moral panics that might make headlines in rightwing tabloids. It’s not like I hadn’t given them the raw material. In the course of my career I’d written pieces with headlines such as “Riots are a class act”, “Let’s have an open and honest conversation about white people” and “End all immigration controls”. I might as well have drawn a target on my back. But the only time I was ever caught in the tabloids’ crosshairs was not because of my denunciations of capitalism or racism, but because of a statue – or to be more precise, the absence of one.\nThe story starts in the mid-19th century, when the designers of Trafalgar Square decided that there would be one huge column for Horatio Nelson and four smaller plinths for statues surrounding it. They managed to put statues on three of the plinths before running out of money, leaving the fourth one bare. A government advisory group, convened in 1999, decided that this fourth plinth should be a site for a rotating exhibition of contemporary sculpture. Responsibility for the site went to the new mayor of London, Ken Livingstone.\n Continue reading...",

Can widespread public opposition overcome huge commercial pressure to go ahead?\nWhen Tokyo’s bid to host the Olympics succeeded eight years ago, a supportive public expected the 2020 Games to be a moment of national unity – and, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, a declaration that the country was open for business. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic forced a delay to 2021.\nWith the rearranged Games due to take place in less than two months the expected respite from the pandemic has not materialised, and with vaccination rates in Japan stubbornly low, polls suggest that as much as 80% of the public wants to see them postponed again or even called off.

          "description": "While the rest of the world decluttered and reimagined ways of doing things, fashion design due Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales of Romance Was Born were doing exactly the same. Over the past 18 months, the pair have been working through boxes of remanent fabric and vintage finds from their studio. On 31 May, they debuted the result at Australian fashion week: two collections constructed almost entirely from dead stock, vintage pieces and other treasures that have piled up over their 16 years in business.\n‘I joke that Anna is a bit of a hoarder,’ says Sales. ‘It’s ... a sentimental way of holding on to something. So if we’ve ever used something in the past and there’s been a scrap of something beaded, Anna has always put it away … kept it stashed for the right time.\n‘During Covid we had the time. That was the right time.’\n Continue reading...",

Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme, dermatologist and founder of Adonia Medical Clinic, says: “Damage to the skin by free radical or reactive oxygen species can include hyperpigmentation, prominent appearance of pores, dull-looking skin and eventually fine lines and premature ageing.”\nThese skin stressors, combined with the added dermatological strain after months of life in lockdown – being indoors with the central heating on, anxiety and lack of sleep – can also leave the skin looking dull and prone to blemishes. A good night’s rest, meditation, a balanced diet and regular exercise can all help with internalised stress and anxiety, but what about the effects of pollution on the skin?\n Continue reading...",
