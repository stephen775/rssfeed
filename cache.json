We open in an antenatal class with three very different women: architect and anxious mother-to-be Cat (Wendy Seager); twentysomething wellness enthusiast Rowan (Anna Russell-Martin); and the highly strung Mobina (Nalini Chetty) who has been to every antenatal class in the book. As the babies arrive one by one, meticulous birthing plans are swept aside and the messy reality of early motherhood is ushered in with conviction, warmth and, thankfully, plenty of humour.\nThe play, presented by Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum and Pitlochry Festival theatre for the Sound Stage series, is split into three parts. Each mum narrates her own section, sharing her private thoughts and fears. Radley captures the strangely competitive atmosphere that can emerge in antenatal classes, which Cat describes brilliantly as: “like The Hunger Games with haemorrhoids.” As Cat whispers to her unborn baby, the intensely private relationship between a mother and her “bean” is conjured into life.\n Continue reading...",

Suddenly, the steering wheel comes off. Flames lick his craft and the noise – my God, the noise – of beeping alarm systems portends what rocket scientists call “nothing good”.\nDo flying saucers even have steering wheels, you ask? Spare me your plodding literalism, I reply. Morty, convinced he and his comatose, sociopathicscience whiz of an uncle Rick are going to die on re-entry, makes his last phone call. What nonsense, you object: I can’t get mobile coverage in the kitchen, let alone outer space. Again, ditch the scepticism, you plum.\n Continue reading...",

On Monday the nationalist Sweden Democrats plunged the country into a political crisis by driving through a no-confidence vote in the centre-left prime minister.

Her party managed only a fifth of the vote nationally and topped the list in only one region, rather than the expected six. Unfortunately, Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche – her probable opponent in next year’s race to the Elysée Palace – did even worse, with only 11% of the national vote.

Demand for short-term and holiday lets on platforms such as Airbnb collapsed. While this was alarming for landlords, it looked as though more property could become available for long-term residential use. In London, rents fell fast. For once, perhaps, the scales could be tipping away from the UK’s two million landlords and towards the 13 million people who rent from them.\nSince this was not the kind of levelling up that ministers had in mind, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, intervened. A stamp duty holiday was introduced and then extended, to pump up prices. A new version of help to buy was launched. Meanwhile, wealthy people saw their savings grow, as opportunities to spend money (restaurants, parties, foreign holidays) shrank: an additional £192bn was put aside in the year following the first lockdown.\n Continue reading...",

In reality, what HSBC and a host of other companies are planning to do is cut the cost of their office footprint by transferring the square footage they pay for in town and city centres to the homes of their staff. So the total office space such companies use is not reduced, it is simply transferred, along with the cost, to the staff who are required to work from home.\nThe implication, of course, is that HSBC et al will enjoy enormous cost savings in terms of rents, building maintenance and, not least of all, business rates, by moving commercial premises to residential settings. Quite apart from issues of planning (ie, residential premises being used for commercial purposes), there is the question of whether someone who uses their home officially for business purposes should be paying towards the shortfall in business rates that local authorities will lose out on as businesses vacate their city/town centre premises – not to mention the knock-on effect on service industries that depend on office workers for their livelihood.

At this unique moment in history, employers can rethink everything\nThere have been few moments in the history of work as pivotal as the one we find ourselves in now. It took a pandemic to normalise remote working, and, despite the fears of many CEOs, most organisations saw no demonstrable loss of productivity. Now, the global workforce is demanding its right to retain the autonomy it gained through increased flexibility as societies open up again. Pre-pandemic, it was not uncommon for an employer to ask staff to justify their need to work from home. Post-pandemic, employees may ask employers to justify the need to come into the office.\nYet many organisations are still resisting this more flexible future. They argue that employees’ wellbeing is compromised by remote working, and that unless they are brought back into the office, many more will suffer from “Zoom fatigue”.\n Continue reading...",

Its finale was a recital by the soprano Carolyn Sampson and baritone Roderick Williams, accompanied by the festival’s artistic director Joseph Middleton, that explored the question of gender in song.\nIt was a cleverly devised, beautifully polished programme, with the two singers taking on songs usually allotted to the opposite sex – Sampson began with two numbers from Schubert’s Die Schöne Mullerin, and Williams with two from Schumann’s Frauenliebe und -leben, for instance – and also inviting the audience to comment on the switches, as well as to nominate the songs they included in a final group; settings by Britten, Schubert, Debussy and Butterworth were among the choices.\n Continue reading...",

This applies especially to periodic Liberal Democrat upsets such as last week’s at Chesham and Amersham in Buckinghamshire, where they overturned a blue majority. This was nothing to do with choosing a government, rather it was passing judgment on Johnson’s “algorithmic” deregulation of rural planning in the south-east. It was about “taking back control”, community politics not party politics.\nThe Lib Dems stand for nothing radical or recognisable, just a vaguely left-of-centre outlook on life. Local issues aside, they appeal to those who vaguely agree with Labour, but cannot quite vote that way. As across Europe, the effect is to split the left-of-centre vote and thus empower the right. Over the weekend, the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, appeared to rule out any formal progressive pact. “We don’t need stitch-ups and deals,” he said. “I’m very sceptical about all that.”\n Continue reading...",

One of the various exercises was to write a short story, a page long, about something dramatic that had happened to us or someone we knew. Having written our page, we were told to read the story back, then cross it out with a single line. The next stage was to write the same story, only this time to take up half a page. Again, we were told to read it, then strike a line through it. The last part was to write the same story in a single sentence, read it twice, then underline two words.\nAlmost without exception, and regardless of where the story had started and how dramatic or bad it was, the sentences were tender and funny. The two words (“busy orange” are the ones I remember best) were all moving and hilarious, which was no doubt also due to the fact that we had been incubating in a strip-lit room that smelled of milky tea and damp carpet. After a break to drink the tea we had been smelling all morning and to eat chocolate bourbons and ginger nuts, we came back to discuss the exercise. It was all about the stories we are tied to, and how we tell them and can change them; at the time, it felt as if we were hitting on the meaning of life. Some things have stayed with me, and nothing more so than the smell and taste of milky tea and a busy orange.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Ten years since the Arab spring rocked Egypt and removed its president, the country is still detaining human rights workers and locking up political prisoners\nKarim Ennarah, a human rights worker for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, was at a beach resort in South Sinai when he was arrested and accused of joining a terrorist group and “spreading false news”. He was detained in a prison in Cairo and became one of thousands of political prisoners in the country. \nEnnarah tells Anushka Asthana that his arrest was only the beginning of his separation from his British wife. Jess Kelly describes to Anushka the moment that she found out her husband had been arrested by the security services as she rode her bike along a London street, and the great difficulties she herself has faced to be reunited with him.\n Continue reading...",

She told the Observer that although advances had been made at the G7 meeting in Cornwall last weekend, progress had not been made on honouring past commitments to find $100bn (£72.5bn) a year to help developing countries invest in green technologies.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "David Hurn’s photograph captures the last hurrah of a decade of freedom\nA hundred and fifty thousand people camped out at the 1969 Isle of Wight festival to see Bob Dylan return to a live stage for the first time in three years. The photographer David Hurn, then 35, got a few pictures of Dylan’s set, but he was more interested in turning his camera on the crowd than the performers. That year’s festival, at the end of August, came a couple of weeks after Woodstock and was perhaps the closest Britain’s festivalgoers ever came to the authentic spirit of the summer of love.\nHurn, who grew up in Wales, had been on the frontline of much of the 1960s; as well as documenting indelible images of early Beatlemania, he had shot the film posters for Sean Connery’s James Bond in From Russia With Love and Jane Fonda’s Barbarella. The 1969 festival, which came a month after the moon landing and the death of Brian Jones, felt like a last hurrah for the decade. Hurn slept near the beach without a tent with the other festivalgoers and when hundreds of people plunged bare-arsed into the sea on the Sunday morning he felt he ought to join in and get naked himself. No other photographer was around to capture this scene, which, for all the cheerful nudity, is made by the presence of the boat at anchor, making the festivalgoers appear like a recently discovered, and distinctly hedonistic, island tribe.\n Continue reading...",

Liam Rosenior and Paul MacInnes reflect on how football became enmeshed in the culture wars\nWhen England’s footballers took to the pitch for their first match of Euro 2020 last Sunday they felt the weight of expectation as one of the tournament’s hotly tipped sides. But after a loudly bellowed national anthem, the team dropped to one knee on the Wembley turf for the anti-racism act that has become a mainstay of English football for the past year. Some of their own supporters loudly booed before the majority drowned them out in applause. \nLiam Rosenior, a former professional footballer currently on the coaching staff at Derby County, tells Anushka Asthana of his sadness but not surprise at the booing. He takes apart the argument that the players are making an overtly political statement and chastises politicians who he believes have sought to use the issue to inflame existing tensions. The Guardian’s sports reporter Paul MacInnes delves into the history of the gesture itself, which gained traction in the US on the back of the long-running anti-racism protest made by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. \n Continue reading...",
