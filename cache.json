We have had films recorded in real time from doctors. We have had thoughtful overviews that piece together our and other countries’ responses with the benefit of hindsight. Earlier this week, we had a Horizon special on the development of the vaccines that may, without hyperbole, save the world.\nArt, however, takes longer. The factual programming has been, almost without exception, terrifically good: sober, meticulous, grappling with vast amounts of data and dramatic footage and wrestling it into comprehensible, valuable forms for an exhausted, bewildered and lay audience. It has informed us, brilliantly. But it is art, the stories we tell ourselves about extraordinary and frequently traumatic experiences, that helps us come to terms with them. Dennis Kelly’s Together (BBC Two) may be the first major work for a mass audience that succeeds in this task.\n Continue reading...",

Going forward after half-time, they looked like the side that had scored 40 goals in qualifying. Romelu Lukaku, the isolation of the first half ended, was exceptional.

While few would want to rely solely on an account from Boris Johnson’s controversial former aide, some of it quickly contested, there is plentiful evidence of the government’s failures.\nThere is no doubt its performance has improved. With Covid cases in the UK now doubling every 11 days, the vaccination push is intensifying; all over-18s can book for theirs from Friday. The speed of the rollout has helped to break the link between infections and deaths. The delay of a further relaxation of restrictions was a welcome and necessary decision.

But unionism’s main party seems to be reverting to protest, not power\nNorthern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party was originally a party of protest. Founded in 1971 by Ian Paisley, it stood for no surrender. It opposed every attempt by successive British governments to build power-sharing institutions, including the Good Friday agreement in 1998. Then, in 2007, the DUP decided to be a party of power, with Mr Paisley becoming Northern Ireland’s first minister. Since then, it has been the main party of government, first under Mr Paisley, then Peter Robinson and, until last month, Arlene Foster. But, under Edwin Poots, the DUP reverted to being a protest party once more.\nMr Poots’s ousting of Mrs Foster was essentially an act of bloodletting between the free presbyterian base of the original Paisleyite party and the DUP’s less doctrinaire members. Some of the latter, alienated by Mrs Foster’s mistakes over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, had already drifted away. But the ousting was a coup without a strategy for winning such voters back; it will lead to further defections. Instead, Mr Poots doubled down on the old religion. His priority was to redirect the party, not to govern Northern Ireland. On Thursday night that effort imploded and Mr Poots had to quit.\n Continue reading...",

A man of great presence and charm, he played a notable role as a leader of the “frontline states” in the long confrontation between independent black Africa and the white-dominated south of the continent, which came to an end only in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa. \nHe was a consummate politician and spent much of his time shuffling his top party figures around in a chess game to balance ethnic groups and their claims to power-sharing; he also possessed a ruthless streak which he deployed towards opponents, although his abhorrence of violence was a rarity in that era.\n Continue reading...",

Put it this way: to be a sportswriter you don’t have to be a narcissistic, thrill-seeking freeloader hooked on the dopamine of likes and retweets and the kick of seeing your name in print. But, um, it doesn’t necessarily hurt.\nThen again, when you work somewhere as renowned as the Guardian, you are frequently reminded that your fragile self-esteem is built on the labours and love of others.

The Guardian’s Adam Gabbatt and former Ministry of Defence employee Nick Pope investigate\nIn December 2020, just before Donald Trump left the White House, the CIA was given six months to release all of the evidence it had gathered in the last 14 years about UFOs. So later this month a highly anticipated report will be released. \nGuardian reporter Adam Gabbatt tells Anushka Asthana that in recent years a series of government videos showing unidentified objects have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong object flying through the sky near San Diego in 2004. The wave of recent videos and the imminent release of the government report has ignited excitement around unidentified flying objects not seen for years. \n Continue reading...",

In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix.
