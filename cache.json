          "description": "This new Irish drama expertly manages a large cast of characters, with seeds of suspicion, red herrings – and a monstrous patriarch left for dead\nSmother (Alibi), a new County Clare-set thriller by novelist and television writer Kate O’Riordan, reminds me – and I have few higher compliments – of the work of Maeve Binchy, if she had ever turned her hand to whodunnits. It has a seemingly effortless mastery of a large cast of characters, warm intelligence pervading everything, and promotes the gorgeous general sense of being held for the duration in a very safe pair of hands indeed. Like Binchy, it is also entirely addictive.\nIt opens with an altercation on a clifftop that ends with a man dead on the beach below. Then, as is currently TV fashion, we spool back to earlier that night, as successful businessman Denis (Stuart Graham) hosts his wife Val’s (Dervla Kirwan) 50th birthday party. Their three daughters are there – Jenny (Niamh Walsh), a heavily pregnant single doctor who works eternally for Daddy’s approval, Anna (Gemma-Leah Devereux), who is in the final stages of a custody battle with her husband Rory’s ex-wife for the latter’s two sons, and Grace (Seána Kerslake), the fragile youngest, struggling with mental illness and currently off her medication.\n Continue reading...",

The potential for major embarrassment ahead of this weekend’s G7 meeting in Cornwall had been averted.\nOr not. Because moments later, Hoyle went on to say that he would be open to an emergency debate the following day if one were to be requested. In a point of order, Mitchell needed no second invitation. He assured the house he had the necessary numbers to win by a majority of between nine and 20 and, though disappointed the vote would not now be legally binding, the debate would give parliament the chance to express its will on the government’s unilateral decision to break its manifesto commitment and cut overseas aid by 0.2%.

          "description": "The government’s plan to slash £4bn from development spending is regressive and must be overturned \nBoris Johnson does not share the liberal belief in progress. “I think that history – societies and civilizations and nations – can rise and fall, and I think that things can go backwards,” he said recently in an interview for The Atlantic, an American magazine. There could be few neater demonstrations of this acceptance of historical regression than the government’s decision to cut the UK’s aid budget by £4bn, which dominated the news just hours after the article was published.\nTo those who believe the aim of politics must be a brighter and more stable future, in which poverty has been eliminated and the risks of runaway global heating contained, the UK’s promise to spend 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid is a powerful symbol. It signals recognition of the obligations of rich nations and people to poorer ones, and a commitment to global cooperation. These ideas are widely shared, for reasons that range from a progressive internationalism to a belief that British “soft power” is part of its role as a former imperial power.\n Continue reading...",

It is a myth that humans are less beautiful as they age – on the contrary. Years ago, to help me to understand things better, I got a season ticket to a Rembrandt exhibition. Many hours, day after day, taught me that, with the more truthful eyes of the artist, age is an etching of beauty on the more stereotyped images that are thrust upon us by adverts, pin-ups and porn. If the rosebush had eyes, it would peer at any human with wonder and exclaim: “How can anything of such wonder, beauty and complexity possibly exist?”\nAn analogy I often use is of the flashy cover on the latest novel in a bookshop, comparing this with the patina, beauty and handcrafting of an antique volume in a museum.

The Delta variant is now dominant in England, and according to a recent risk assessment from Public Health England (PHE), it has a substantially increased rate of transmissibility compared with the previously dominant variant Alpha, which was first sequenced in the UK. Having just a single dose of vaccination is less effective against Delta, and it may lead to a surge in hospital cases.\nWe always knew variants were a risk to England’s roadmap out of lockdown. In January, the science advisory group Sage warned that England’s red-list border policy of “geographically targeted travel bans” was unlikely to keep new variants out, not least because we didn’t know where the next one would come from. England spent the winter trying to keep out the Beta variant, first sequenced in South Africa, and the Gamma variant, first detected in Japan in travellers from Brazil. The effort mostly succeeded, but the government’s red-list policy entirely missed the rise of a dangerous new variant in India.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Mark, 71, and Andrew, 73, met at university in Scotland and have been together for almost 50 years. They live in London\nMark was deeply unhappy when he started at St Andrews University in Scotland in 1967. He had grown up feeling conflicted about his sexuality, and though sex between two men had been decriminalised in England and Wales that summer, it remained illegal in the rest of the UK, and attitudes towards gay people remained extremely hostile. “Sex education taught me that my feelings were abnormal. I was waiting for the phase to end,” he says. In his first week, he met Andrew, who had moved from the US to study. “We didn’t know each other well. He was on the fringes of my social group,” says Mark, 71. Andrew found Mark attractive, but had never considered a relationship with another man. “I’d been in a fraternity and had girlfriends. Being gay hadn’t really crossed my mind,” he says.\nAfter completing his degree, Mark moved to London in 1972 and found work in the film industry. “I realised my sexuality was nothing to be ashamed of and told all my friends,” he says. Andrew, 73, spent a year in Virginia after his studies, before moving to Edinburgh to complete a PhD. By the early 70s, he too had begun to explore his sexuality, and was secretary of the Edinburgh University GaySoc. “Some friends told me that Mark had come out. They said: ‘He’s done just about everything bar putting out a personal ad to tell everyone he’s queer.’” In the autumn of 1974, he called Mark. “I was going for dinner with a mutual friend of ours, so I invited him to come along,” says Mark. “I spotted Andrew on Shaftesbury Avenue and he looked totally different. He’d shaved off the Gilbert and Sullivan sideburns he’d had at university.” \n Continue reading...",

I chose fairly low repayments and a long mortgage term, reflective of my financial circumstances at the time. Last year, I secured an amazing job with a much higher salary and it has changed my life. I’ve paid off all my other debts – apart from my student loan and mortgage – and now have savings and investments. My mortgage is a five-year fixed rate with an interest rate of 1.54% and 23 years left of the mortgage term.\nI have calculated that between overpayments and reducing my mortgage term, on my current salary, I could be mortgage-free in the next five to seven years. My thinking is to reduce the balance while I am still in the fixed rate-period, and then just pay off the rest using my cash savings (since they are earning very little interest) when it moves to the standard variable rate (SVR).\n Continue reading...",
