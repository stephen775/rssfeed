The book found favour in the most mainstream of media, from Time magazine to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and became a New York Times No 1 best-seller as the so-called renaissance in psychedelic research took hold around the world.\n Continue reading...",

Author Chardi Christian, his wife of 50 years, nods. “[But] we worked hard at not [splitting],” says David, “and in fact I think we both really didn’t want to split.”\nBeing in a relationship that endures is something many people aspire to – the romantic ideal of having someone to accompany you through life’s countless ups and downs. And research shows there are very real benefits to being in a successful long-term relationship: couples who stay together are healthier, wealthier, happier, having more sex and living longer than their solo peers.\n Continue reading...",

It’s thoroughly silly, but you’ll surely be hooked\nThe Masked Singer usually occupies that lovely Saturday teatime slot that suits mindless television blessed with a touch of the surreal. That slot is why I have spent the past few weeks engrossed in I Can See Your Voice, wondering if a prison officer is lip-syncing to his own voice or not. Now that everyone is doing singing-based guessing games, The Masked Singer – as if bored with its own invention – has briefly transformed into The Masked Dancer (ITV). Over seven episodes starting tonight, celebrities will dress up in elaborate costumes and perform dance routines, while a panel of other celebrities will suggest that an A-list Hollywood star is the one galavanting around on stage in a glittery costume of a root vegetable.\nI love The Masked Singer, despite recognising that it is a colossal waste of time, simply because it is so good-natured and ridiculous. Few could have guessed there would be any difficulty involved in guessing some of the participants by their voices, especially when those participants were famous singers. But it proved harder than it looked. You could think: that is definitely Gabrielle, then second-guess that it would be far too easy if it were Gabrielle; the whole thing would unravel, until the mask came off and of course it was Gabrielle after all.\n Continue reading...",

The ex-adviser had been forced out of Downing Street last November in a power struggle that had involved the prime minister’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds. Downing Street was on edge because Cummings had been firing off ominous preparatory salvoes on Twitter for days. But after a morning in the witness chair he had already exceeded his billing, unleashing accusations of such gravity that at times the MPs (and presumably much of the public watching on TV) found it all but impossible to keep up.\n Continue reading...",

The daughter of Lucien Freud and Bernardine Coverley, she trained as an actor before becoming a novelist. Freud has three children with the actor David Morrissey, from whom she recently separated. I Couldn’t Love You More is the story of three generations of Irish women: Rosaleen, a heroic, headstrong teenager in the early 1960s who begins an affair with an older man; Aoife, her mother, who recounts her life to her dying husband and wonders what became of her flighty daughter; and Kate, in London, married to the useless Matt, trying to make it as an artist while looking after their daughter, Freya. The three lives intertwine and overlap over the course of the novel.\nYou say in the acknowledgments that I Couldn’t Love You More was inspired by your own mother, bringing up children unmarried and without the support of her family.\nI didn’t start the book with the intention of telling that story. I was thinking how much I’d like to write a book where love was the main theme. So I started with a real rush of energy, writing about it from different points of view, three women from different generations. I began really playfully and freely, writing these short chapters. After a while I realised I needed a story and some kind of plot, and it was then that it occurred to me to think more about my mother and how extraordinary it was that she managed to have two children without her parents knowing, and what it was like to be in such an unsupported world.\n Continue reading...",

According to an account written by officers, the handcuff was used to “[give] him pain”, a reference to a restraint technique which involves deliberately inflicting suffering to gain submission.

Understandable really. She took his best mate away. They were so close, but then she came along and Boris didn’t have time for him any more… Oh sorry, I appear to have segued into a half-remembered Byker Grove storyline – a “teaching moment” for schoolboy viewers about feeling left out when your mate gets a girlfriend. Only in the Westminster version, a pandemic is brewing and Cummings depicts Symonds “going crackers about something completely trivial” – a story claiming that Dilyn, the jack russell cross she rescued with Boris Johnson, was being “reshuffled”. Thing is, though, I understand why Symonds was upset and I rather like her for it.\nCummings clearly wanted to present Symonds as a Violet Elizabeth Bott figure, a preposterous, demanding drag on the prime minister’s focus at a critical moment. Admittedly, the now-leaked letter of complaint Symonds drafted to the Times is an overwrought belter, citing violations, demanding corrections and ending with the classic: “We look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency.” Elsewhere, never mind the first fiancee’s taste for swanky decor, stories abound about her pushing animal welfare agendas and exerting undue influence over No 10 hiring and firing. Still, when it comes to being a pandemic liability, I have two words for Cummings: “Barnard” and “Castle”. As for the letter, it’s an absurd, messy, emotional overreaction… and I completely relate.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "101 Dalmatians’s Cruella de Vil gets an origin story, with a sneering Emma Stone, an icy Emma Thompson – and clothes to die for\nIn 1996’s 101 Dalmatians, Glenn Close’s gleefully unhinged performance as a puppy-skinning fashion designer riffed on older audience members’ prior knowledge of the actor as a “bunny boiler” in Fatal Attraction. Emma Stone’s Cruella de Vil is much more grounded and thus not as camp, a supervillain with a believable backstory – born Estella, bullied by boys at school and established as a maverick who’s always refused to “follow the pattern” (as her single mother puts it) in both dressmaking and in life.\nSet in 1970s London against a backdrop of the emerging punk scene, this playful prequel by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) is a fine feat of world-building. Like Phantom Thread or Marie Antoinette, it’s also an excellent fashion film, playing on the myth of the egocentric, detail-oriented genius. One of its main narrative threads involves Estella’s apprenticeship at, and eventual sabotage of, a couture fashion house headed by an icy narcissist named The Baroness (Emma Thompson, exuding Meryl Streep’s energy in The Devil Wears Prada). Fashion enthusiasts may also draw connections between the House of Baroness’s sculptural, Dior-esque gowns and Estella’s Alexander McQueen-influenced lace and leather looks (McQueen, of course, succeeded John Galliano at Givenchy in the 90s when the latter moved to Dior). There is even a reference to McQueen’s 2011 monarch butterfly dress.\n Continue reading...",

After she had died, when my mother and I prised out the needles that the nurses hadn’t taken from her neck and wrist, she continued to bleed. My mother, a British Pakistani Muslim who practises her faith quietly but assiduously, whispered the Qur’anic surah Yaseen in her right ear and told me she had seen a tiny black pearl slip out from under Fauzia’s eyelid – a single jewel of a tear – which she had caught in the palm of her hand just before it disappeared, along with my sister’s soul.

Mars House itself is nothing more than a string of ones and zeroes residing on a server somewhere. But the NFT isn’t even that string. All it is is another such string pointing to that one, certifying that it is the only copy of that precise sequence of ones and zeroes in existence. Put aside, if you can, the obscenity of a purely virtual dwelling selling for half a million dollars.

There’s a good reason, though, she tells me with her usual disregard for social niceties. “I’ve spent most of the time in the nuthouse. I’ve been practically living there for six years.” She pauses, takes an intense drag on her fag, and warns me off being similarly politically incorrect. “We alone get to call it the nuthouse – the patients.”\nO’Connor is a music great – her 1990 version of Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U is one of the most transcendent five minutes in pop history, the solitary tear falling from her eye in the accompanying video one of its most beautiful images. The single topped the charts worldwide, as did the album it was taken from, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got. Astonishingly, in the 31 years that have passed, she has never had another UK Top 10 hit single and only one Top 10 album. And yet she remains a household name.\n Continue reading...",

Judge Larisa Alwin ruled that Shell, one of the world’s biggest oil companies, must cut its emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to 2019 levels. Until Wednesday, courts in the Netherlands, France and Germany had concentrated on holding governments to their commitments under the Paris climate deal of 2015. States were found guilty of denying basic rights to future citizens, triggering more ambitious climate plans. The landmark Hague ruling shows that corporations can now be ordered to comply with the goals of the Paris agreement.\nGovernments are supposed to design the regulatory frameworks and put in place the laws so that companies and households steadily reduce their carbon emissions. But this relies on private entities playing their part. If they do not, preferring to hide behind slick PR, the law can step in. The judge accepted the argument that Shell had failed in its duty to respect human rights by failing to adequately curb its role in global heating. Shell’s goals to mitigate its climate impact, the court found, “largely amount to rather intangible, undefined and non-binding plans for the long term”.\n Continue reading...",

The work of over 20 years, it defines 37,000 words. One might wonder why such a thing might be needed. After all, Liddell and Scott’s Greek dictionary, with its early-20th-century revisions, has served scholars well since 1843. And isn’t ancient Greek a dead language anyway?\nBy no means. Scholars constantly broaden knowledge of the language. The later 19th century saw a profusion of Greek texts excavated in Egypt, where the dry sands preserved millions of papyrus fragments – not just literature but bills, letters and even magical spells, full of new usages that are still being studied (not all of this is reflected in the new lexicon). In recent decades, the canon has broadened towards the abundant Greek writing produced under the Roman empire – though, since the new dictionary advances only to the second century AD, it, alas, omits much of this material.\n Continue reading...",
