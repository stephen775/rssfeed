          "description": "Pratt plays a teacher turned pre-emptive conscript for a future war with aliens in this overlong and derivative actioner\nWe’ve come an awfully long way since Chris Pratt was the goofy comic turn Andy Dwyer in TV’s Parks and Recreation, pretending to be top-secret FBI agent Burt Macklin. These days he’s got the chops to be a tough, chiselled action lead who removes his shirt to reveal some serious work with the personal trainer, and this is how he’s presented in this great big overstuffed and overlong sci-fi action thriller from former animation director Chris McKay. In Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World, Pratt had at least some residue of his former comedy existence, and to be fair there are one or two funny lines here (coming largely from JK Simmons, playing Pratt’s grumpy yet adorable dad), but this is a very earnest and generic lead performance.\nPratt plays Dan Forester, an idealistic soldier-turned-high school teacher with a wife and young daughter; he lives in an America that is suddenly terrified by visitors from the future who reveal that in 30 years’ time Earth will be attacked by weird, white, lizard-like creatures (not a million miles away from those in the sci-fi horror A Quiet Place). Humanity is so low on soldiers that they have to time-travel into the past to recruit more personnel and bring them into the future to fight this “tomorrow war” against the alien creatures. And Dan is duly drafted into the head-spinningly weird conflict, coming into contact with fellow warriors like cheerfully nerdy Charlie (Sam Richardson), tough and cynical Dorian (Edwin Hodge) and also Norah (Mary Lynn Rajskub). But most importantly there is the charismatic female commanding officer, played by Yvonne Strahovski (from The Handmaid’s Tale). The encounter messes with Dan’s mind: you’ve heard of back to the future, but this is forward to the past, or maybe sideways to the next generation.\n Continue reading...",

But pop music works up the romantic atmosphere in Yolanda Mercy’s adaptation of the pastoral comedy, directed by Paul Hart. Staged in the Watermill’s verdant grounds (weeping willows, ducks, gushing water), the actors sing and play a blend of folksy guitar, ukulele, bass, harp and flute.\nIts bigger message is on environmental change and Katie Lias’s set design carries that symbolism: the court, filled with empty oil drums, is part construction site and part derelict greenhouse where characters wear hard-hats and hi-vis vests. The lush forest of Arden blends into the theatre’s grounds so that we are not only told that “all the world’s a stage” but understand that this stage is our own world, too, and needs rewilding. Actors walk among us to blur the boundaries further.\n Continue reading...",

Sir Simon Stevens has run the service for seven years and his departure coincides with a shake-up. His successor will be a less powerful figure, who stands, in an upcoming health bill, to be stripped of the independence granted as part of the last round of Conservative reforms.\nGiving control back to ministers was always a questionable move, particularly given the government’s record during the pandemic. Circumstances surrounding the departure of Matt Hancock have heightened concerns about cronyism. But the prospect of the service’s new boss being chosen by a newcomer, Sajid Javid, does not inspire confidence either (the task is undertaken jointly with NHS England’s board). At a time of great peril for the service and the 56 million people who rely on it (just 11% of the UK population are thought to have private health insurance), the situation is chaotic, with health minister Lord Bethell also facing questions about why he sponsored Gina Coladangelo for a parliamentary pass.\n Continue reading...",

But it is not a major error nor a grammatical blunder; it is acceptable, even necessary, when considerations of rhythm and clarity require it.” What’s good enough for Fowler is good enough for me.\nSalley Vickers\nLondon\n• The “rule” about not splitting infinitives doesn’t apply to English: it derives from the mistaken notion that the English verb consists in a single word that mustn’t be interrupted in the middle, in common with Latin and the Romance languages derived from it. “To hardly try” is correct English; “to try hardly” is nonsense, and “hardly to try” in most contexts sounds formal.

As the pandemic furlough winds down this week, one generation is destined for a mighty windfall from the government while the other gets nothing. The reason is clear: the Tories win three times more votes from one group than the other.\nAs of this week, employers start picking up the furlough bill, previously paid by the government, and many will let staff go, with their businesses still running on empty. Most of those losing jobs will be young people in the low-paid hospitality, arts, entertainment and tourism sectors, who, warns the Resolution Foundation, will struggle to find work: reports of worker shortages “have been overplayed”, and so have reports of steep pay rises.

The overenthusiastic “let’s put on a show!” mania of cast reunions filmed over Zoom quickly gave way to the gnawing listlessness depicted in Bo Burnham’s comedy special Inside. Another part of the line, however, happened by accident.\nNetflix’s Sweet Tooth is a series about a devastating global pandemic that kills millions of people and resets humanity. It was filmed last summer, in that brief golden gulp between Covid lockdowns.

She explains why she’s drawn to strong, resilient characters\nTamara Lawrance says she has “very little desire to be pregnant” and, given the subject matter of her latest film, who can blame her? She stars in the dread-filled psychological horror Kindred as Charlotte, a young woman living in an isolated part of rural England, whose life plans go awry when she gets pregnant with her boyfriend (Edward Holcroft) and is taken into the quasi-care of his sinister family, in their crow-infested, crumbling mansion. Fiona Shaw makes for an imperious matriarch, while Jack Lowden is unnervingly obsequious as the black-sheep stepbrother.\n“I really enjoyed the fact that [Charlotte] was not maternal,” says Lawrance, describing the allure of the script by writer-director Joe Marcantonio. “It’s an assumption that women are born with this innate, God-given inclination to take care of babies and there’s countless testimonies of that, but there’s also a wealth of other experience and evidence out there.” To be a woman aged anywhere between 25 and 45 is to be bombarded with images of maternal fulfilment, plus a constant stream of questions regarding one’s womb.\n Continue reading...",

His quip lives on because it expresses the absurdity of societies that treat immigration as purely a question of economic need, reducing people to units that can be moved here and there as capital sees fit.\nHowever partial and flawed it may be, the EU’s system of internal free movement is an attempt to escape that trap. In stripping away the obstacles and restrictions that continue to govern migration for most of the world, it is an acknowledgment that when people move, they develop new attachments to the places they come to call home and to the people they come to call neighbours – and a wager that the best way to grow a shared sense of belonging is to make that process as easy as possible.\n Continue reading...",

Have their dreams of burgeoning veg patches and frolicking livestock come true?\nOn their one-acre plot of Hertfordshire countryside, Sarah Apps and Liam Armstrong live with three chickens, 59 tomato plants and – until this morning – three pigs. “It’s been an emotional day,” says Apps. They plan to get more pigs later in the summer, and next week more chickens are arriving; then ducks and a goat, a couple of turkeys for Christmas and, maybe next year, bees. Living on their own land, and becoming more self-sufficient, had been a bit of a dream for the couple, but it took the Covid pandemic to make it happen. “You just didn’t know what was going to happen,” says Apps. “Young people were dying, older people were dying … I think you really need to live for the days that you’ve got.”\nWhen they spotted a run-down bungalow that came with an acre of land, they went for it. They had been living in Romford, East London. “We could hear the roar of the M25 and I could barely be bothered to mow the small patch of lawn we had,” says Apps. They moved in November and spent the winter creating raised vegetable beds, putting in fencing and making animal enclosures. It has been gruelling physical work – they have done it mostly by hand – moving around 30 tonnes of soil. “It was our fitness thing through lockdown,” says Apps. But now they have growing just about every type of vegetable you’d find in a well-stocked supermarket, eggs every day, and in a few days the pigs will return for the freezer. She breaks off to check on a chicken who is in their kitchen. “She’s just had a bath. She’s not very well.”\n Continue reading...",

Does its demise signal a new chapter in Hong Kong?\nApple Daily is one of Hong Kong’s most popular newspapers, standing for freedom of speech and backing the city’s pro-democracy movement as it attempted to resist Beijing’s draconian national security law and wider attempts to muzzle dissent. Last week, after hundreds of police raided the publication’s headquarters, confiscated journalists’ laptops and arrested senior staff, it published its final edition. Even after many setbacks for activists, the closure of the newspaper has been seen as a significant development – and, some argue, the end of freedom of speech in the city.\nRachel Humphreys spoke to a journalist there as they worked to put out that last issue. And she hears from Helen Davidson, reporting from Taipei, about how events of the past fortnight have unfolded, and the Guardian’s China affairs correspondent, Vincent Ni, about what the closure says about Beijing’s approach to Hong Kong – and what signal it sends to China’s citizens about the perils of dissent.\n Continue reading...",

The resulting byelection takes place tomorrow and the race to replace her as MP is far from assured for Labour. Their candidate Kim Leadbeater is sister of Jo Cox, the Batley and Spen MP murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016. \nMaya Wolfe-Robinson tells Anushka Asthana how she has been visiting the constituency for weeks and describes an increasingly fraught campaign, which was upended by the entry of former Labour MP George Galloway into the race. His candidacy threatens to split the Labour vote by appealing directly to the area’s Muslim population on issues such as Palestinian rights and the crisis in Kashmir. Meanwhile, the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson is hoping to benefit from a reduced Labour vote that would allow him to add to Boris Johnson’s majority and take a seat last won by his party in 1992. \n Continue reading...",
