So much for theories. Instead, it turned into a night of frustration, when the flaws in Gareth Southgate’s attacking gameplan were etched across Wembley and Scotland revelled in showing their old rivals that it is a perilous business to write them off.\nOn an occasion that will live long in the memories of the few thousand visiting fans in attendance, who included Sir Alex Ferguson, their team defied England, holding them at arm’s length with a performance of spirit and no little quality.

They were lovers as students and now, back in the house where they first hooked up, they’re looking to rekindle things. Only they can’t find a light. “Is there meant to be electricity?” asks Alex. It’s a line that is supposed to shimmer with subtext but feels heavy handed in a play about lost love, lost youth and lost people that fails to flare into life.\nDeborah Bruce’s previous play at Hampstead theatre, Godchild, was about a fortysomething woman struggling to let go of her youth. In Raya, the female protagonist, Alex, is a few years older and in the grips of menopause. Price performs with a fragile intensity and Alex’s monologues contain a few striking observations (“I can’t be at home – I’m drab in all my mirrors”). But the vast majority of the play does not feel this focused or truthful. The plot twists, when they eventually come, land with a thud. Price and Poraj have a nice spiky chemistry but the erratic script often works against them. There’s an extraordinarily hard-working bottle of wine, which is used with alarming regularity to keep the play moving, and the characters are given increasingly random reasons to drink, stay on stage and keep talking.\n Continue reading...",

They have never lost against a Portugal side containing Cristiano Ronaldo and in fact it gets even better: the record reads played four, won four, with an aggregate in their favour of 11 goals to three.\nThat tally suggests a freewheeling spirit Joachim Löw could do with rekindling when they meet again, for the first time in seven years, on Saturday. A win is not essential to their advancement in Euro 2020: the fact they finish their Group F campaign against a workaday Hungary sees to that. But Germany need to show they can topple another of the tournament’s front runners, preferably with a display of ambition and brio. Much less, and question marks will continue to hover well into next week.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Clearly the death of Liberal England has been prematurely foretold, but more will be needed to turn a stunning byelection win into a successful revival\n\nIt is often hard to try to derive a national message from a single byelection. The effect on party morale usually dwarfs that felt on government policy. The election of Liberal Democrat Sarah Green as the MP for Chesham and Amersham, a commuter-belt seat north-west of London, stuns on both counts. The result will make Conservative MPs in relatively liberal and educated constituencies very jumpy. But it will also slow the progress of Boris Johnson’s planning reforms. Voters in bucolic Buckinghamshire plainly feared that these would make it easier for developers to concrete over the countryside.\nWhat the result shows is that the Liberal Democrat cause is not a hopeless one. With just 11 parliamentarians and languishing at 7% in national polls, Sir Ed Davey appeared to be taking his depleted ranks and marching them towards the sound of gunfire. Chesham and Amersham has been held by the Conservatives since its creation in 1974. Yet Ms Green overturned a 16,000-strong Tory majority to take the seat by just over 8,000 votes, a swing of 25%, and upset the odds. The energy of the Tories’ vaccine bounce seems dissipated. Clearly the death of Liberal England has been prematurely foretold.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "The collapse in rape prosecutions has created a climate of impunity. Women are right to be furious \nThe pledges made by ministers in their keenly awaited rape review must lead to immediate and tightly focused action, enabled by sufficient funding. The current picture with regard to the criminal justice system’s handling of rape is a disaster, of which ministers have rightly said that they are ashamed. Of 52,210 rapes recorded in 2020, just 843 resulted in a charge or a summons. Emily Hunt, an independent adviser to the review and a victim of a sexual offence herself, sums up the situation accurately in saying that rape victims are “nearly always” failed.\nSome of the reasons for this are, as the review recognises, complex. These include a chronic failure to reckon with the digital environment and the vast information trails it creates. Others are pretty straightforward, notably the destructive impact of austerity. Prosecuting rape and other sexual offences is acknowledged by all to be difficult. The disbanding of specialist teams in police forces had predictably harmful effects. Chaos in the courts system leading to delays, and a lack of victim support, have also contributed to a collapse in confidence: the proportion of complainants dropping out of cases rose from 25% to 43% in five years.\n Continue reading...",

Its director, David Lynch, had the first stab at designing workable prosthetics. “But when I tried a piece of it on John Hurt,” Lynch recalled, “he couldn’t move and he said, ‘A valiant effort, David’.” Lynch was plunged into despair, certain that his film would be a disaster, until the British makeup artist Christopher Tucker came to the rescue. But applying the resulting designs, which had been modelled from a cast of the real Joseph Merrick, whose story the movie told, fell upon the makeup artist Walter Schneiderman.\nSchneiderman, who has died aged 98, called the film “one of the hardest pictures I had to do”. It took seven hours each day to put the makeup on Hurt, and another two to take it off again. “Everything was so precise,” he said. “There were 14 pieces, not including the head, and they had to be applied exactly, every day for continuity. You couldn’t afford to make a mistake.” Schneiderman was acclaimed for his work on the movie, which was nominated for eight Oscars. The lack of official recognition for Tucker and Schneiderman caused a furore, which led to the implementation the following year of a new Oscar category for best makeup.\n Continue reading...",

It is likely that a considerable number, between 3,000 and 6,000, stand to lose the right to drive as of the end of this year. This is because Boris Johnson’s withdrawal agreement made no provision for an exchange of licences between our two countries. The only option for these Brits, many of them elderly and in rural areas, will be compulsory driving tuition followed by a written and practical test – all in French, of course. Happily, this is not the outcome for citizens of over 150 other countries, including South Korea and Botswana, who have long since negotiated exchange agreements with France.\nMichael Steadman \nLa Mailhoulié, Amarens, France\n• You have highlighted the difficulties that UK nationals living in France may face if they have not yet applied for post-Brexit residential status. In some areas, French public administration has a well-deserved reputation for obtuseness, but I have just received my residency card and I can attest to the sympathetic and helpful way the authorities have acted.

Then, for about two hours at the start of June, he’s happy. And then he gets hay fever. It was years before I really believed in it. I thought it was like when people say they have an allergy when really they are on a diet. I definitely remember, when I was a kid, that it was just something you said for an extra 15 minutes on your exam times.\nMore years passed before it entered my parental toolkit, and I could reliably put my hands on a packet of antihistamines every day. My learning curve veered sharply upwards the year I had to take him to A&E because he couldn’t breathe, and that was hay fever – particularly since, on the same day, my daughter had broken her foot and I thought it was a sprain. So I was back in A&E a day later, having to explain why hay fever was higher up my list of emergencies than broken bones. Trampolines and pollen shot up my risk register over this period.\n Continue reading...",

But while the media largely stayed away, the Liberal Democrats’ unexpected success in suburban Buckinghamshire – where their vote jumped by 30 percentage points, while the Tories’ dropped by 20 – went with the grain of a slowly emerging shift that some of us have been following for the past three or four years, which is much cultural as political.\n Continue reading...",

Let’s all imagine that we have better, more famous dads.\nNo, we should. Sony Pictures has just suggested we do exactly that, and released a study revealing that almost one in 10 of us wish that Tom Hanks would play our dad in a film. And that makes sense, more or less, because Hanks exudes a steady paternalism in most of his films. He played a father surrogate in News of the World, and Woody from Toy Story is one of the all-time great non-dad dads in cinema.

          "description": "England’s footballers will take the knee before their match against Scotland at Wembley tonight in an anti-racism protest that has divided supporters. Liam Rosenior and Paul MacInnes reflect on how football became enmeshed in the culture wars\nWhen England’s footballers took to the pitch for their first match of Euro 2020 last Sunday they felt the weight of expectation as one of the tournament’s hotly tipped sides. But after a loudly bellowed national anthem, the team dropped to one knee on the Wembley turf for the anti-racism act that has become a mainstay of English football for the past year. Some of their own supporters loudly booed before the majority drowned them out in applause. \nLiam Rosenior, a former professional footballer currently on the coaching staff at Derby County, tells Anushka Asthana of his sadness but not surprise at the booing. He takes apart the argument that the players are making an overtly political statement and chastises politicians who he believes have sought to use the issue to inflame existing tensions. The Guardian’s sports reporter Paul MacInnes delves into the history of the gesture itself, which gained traction in the US on the back of the long-running anti-racism protest made by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. \n Continue reading...",
