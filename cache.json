She had been marching along the pavement alone. This Kafkaesque scene happened not in China, but in Hong Kong. The fate of “Granny Wong”, a 65-year-old protest veteran called Alexandra Wong Fung-yiu, underlines the rapidity of Beijing’s clampdown in the city where, just two years ago, 180,000 people attended the annual vigil remembering the 1989 killings in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\nThis year the Hong Kong vigil has been banned. Anyone gathering at the vigil site in Victoria Park on Friday could face five years in prison. Even publicising the event could lead to one year in jail under Hong Kong’s draconian National Security law, imposed sight unseen at the end of last June following a year of massive pro-democracy demonstrations. Public commemoration has become so risky that one Hong Kong newspaper even suggested writing the digits “64”, to commemorate the date of the protest, on light switches, so that flipping the switch became an act of remembrance. These moves underline the dangerous power of public memory, and how the events of 32 years ago still represent a suppurating sore at the moral heart of China’s Communist party.\n Continue reading...",

But Naftali Bennett’s government will struggle to build the new politics the nation badly needs\nThere were 38 minutes left when eight very disparate Israeli opposition parties announced, just before midnight on Wednesday, that they could form a government to eject Benjamin Netanyahu from the prime ministership he has held for 12 bitter years. This last-minute outcome underscores two things. First, it says the eight-party grouping, which ranges from the leftwing Meretz to the small and ultra-nationalist Yamina of the prospective prime minister Naftali Bennett, and which will be supported by the Arab Islamist Ra’am party, is an exceptionally fragile coalition even by modern Israeli standards. Second, it shows that, in spite of Israel’s successful Covid campaign and the heightened national feeling arising from its recent conflict with Hamas, a very wide range of political groups from very different traditions nevertheless believe they have an overriding shared interest in ousting the country’s longest-serving and still ruthless leader.\nThis is not surprising. Mr Netanyahu may have dominated Israeli politics for a generation. But his militant divisiveness at home and abroad, and his stridently anti-Palestinian policies, have taken the country into a political blind alley. The defeat of Donald Trump has left Mr Netanyahu without his strongest international backer. He is also currently on trial for corruption, facing bribery and fraud charges arising out of three different cases of trading political favours for cash. Each of the last four general elections has ended in stalemate or something very close, most recently in March 2021. If the country was not to waste another few months under yet another unsuccessful Netanyahu regime, there had to be some sort of break. The March election has provided that opportunity – just.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Susan Hemmings would like to know the origins of the directive that led to elderly patients being discharged from hospitals without being tested for coronavirus\nI was relieved to see, in letters (30 May), the truths gradually emerging on the care home tragedy. The unspeakable duty-of-care failure of both the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care has often been described as returning elderly patients to “their care homes” untested for Covid. Yes, that was bad enough. But what they also did was even worse. They billeted many of them, whose beds they were told were now needed, to care homes they did not in fact come from. Untested. The NHS complied with the DHSC directive and so did the care homes. They did not want to, but they did. I am among the traumatised bereaved. She was rapidly killed via an infected and untested incomer. All the staff could do was to weep as, pitifully poorly protected themselves in those first couple of weeks, they saw their loved long-term charges and some of their colleagues die one by one. Something they will never recover from. We need a thorough investigation of where that billeting directive originated, and exactly who thought that was ethical. That is owed to us.\nSusan Hemmings\nLondon\n• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

          "description": "The issue is often framed around ageing. But disabled people of all ages urgently need answers to the social care question \nThere cannot be many adults in the UK who are unaware of the importance of social care. Whether they have encountered the issue through personal experience of supporting friends or relatives, or on the news, most will also recognise that meeting the needs of the growing number of people who cannot take care of themselves is a serious challenge. What fewer may notice is that the most common framing of the care issue, as primarily linked to ageing, longer life expectancy and rising numbers of people with dementia, is partly misleading.\nIn 2018-19, almost 300,000 people aged between 18 and 64 received council-funded social care in England (arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat different). Most of this care went to people in their homes, and around 70% of those who qualified did so due to learning difficulties. This group made up around a third of the total and accounted for around half of public spending on social care. The social care crisis, as it is often called, is thus as much about disability as ageing.\n Continue reading...",

There must have been concerns that the lack of black faces in the palace could be turned into legal action. Even devotees of royalty raised voices suggesting, albeit very gently, that this situation should change. One of the most flattering of the Queen’s biographers, Elizabeth Longford, commented in 1983 that “people are still hoping that a post might be found for someone from her black Commonwealth, high up on her permanent staff”.\nIn fact, another fairly uncritical writer about the monarchy noted in the 1980s that the practice was to appoint, on a two-year stint, an assistant press officer to the Queen, rotating the job between someone from Canada, New Zealand and Australia – that is, countries from the predominantly white Commonwealth. That author, Douglas Keay, wrote that there had been a move backed by Prince Charles to find “another black person to take up the position, but in the end it came to nothing”. Longford noted there had been a Nigerian equerry at court for a few weeks prior to her visit there in 1956, and a Ghanian press officer appointed ahead of her visit to Ghana in 1959, but after that nothing at a senior level.\n Continue reading...",

But for her to have a belly, let alone one that wobbles and jiggles in the way most 45-year-old women’s middles quite unremarkably do, is still apparently a thing so shocking as to make headline news. This week the star of the cult TV drama Mare of Easttown disclosed that she had refused her director’s offer to edit out footage of her “bulgy bit of belly” from a sex scene, arguing that her character should be allowed to look like the woman she was meant to be: a middle-aged small town detective who has carried two children, unwinds after an exhausting day with a beer rather than a gym session, and has rather more serious things to worry about than the odd flabby bit hanging over her jeans.\n“She’s a fully functioning, flawed woman with a body and a face that moves in a way that is synonymous with her age and her life and where she comes from. I think we’re starved of that a bit,” as Winslet, who not only starred in but executive produced the show, puts it. Not since the eponymous heroine of Shirley Valentine ran away to Greece in search of one last adventure, and marvelled at her new lover’s willingness to kiss her stretchmarks, has a naked stomach on film been deemed to make such a statement.\n Continue reading...",

I saw someone filming a police horse and I asked him why. He said: ‘I’m making this for the film department.’ I had signed up for chemistry, but I didn’t like chemistry. So I went to the office of its head – the film-maker Hans Richter – and I said, ‘Professor, are there any opportunities in film?’ He said, ‘Yes – opportunities are plenty. But no jobs!’ I went anyway.” He chuckles fondly.\nKirchheimer was born in 1931 in Saarbrücken, Germany. His Jewish parents, sensing which way the winds were blowing, moved to the US five years later, eventually landing in New York’s Washington Heights, where they joined a close-knit and prosperous community peopled by so many exiles it was sometimes known as Frankfurt-on-the Hudson. Kirchheimer might have stopped practising the faith in his early 20s, but across the decades, his films all benefit – rely, even – on his migrant eye. They’re endlessly curious about how his adopted city works, searching for its often-overlooked architectural or environmental details, alive to its marginal voices.\n Continue reading...",

The second-most decorated men’s swimmer in Olympic history has married and become a father of two. He’s also been branded as a global symbol of privilege after an eponymous Rio Olympics scandal where he lied about being robbed at gunpoint, served two lengthy suspensions and admitted himself to rehab for alcohol addiction after one TMZ headline too many. Peaks and troughs, as they say.\nYet through all the tumult, Lochte has never meaningfully wavered in his goal of swimming in a fifth Olympics. And when the US swimming trials begin on Friday in Omaha, the 36-year-old will attempt to make it a reality. His best chance is expected to come on Sunday night in the 200m individual medley, the event where he set a world record nearly a decade ago that stands today. Should he earn a spot on the US team for Tokyo, he will become the oldest American male swimmer to ever compete at an Olympics.\n Continue reading...",

Like many GPs, I’m very concerned about the implications this has for my patients. A growing number of us in London have taken taken the decision to pull the plug on the new data-sharing programme with NHS Digital and refuse to hand over patient records.\nThis data grab is unwarranted, unparalleled in its scale and implications and quite possibly unlawful. Yet NHS Digital, acting at the government’s request, has downplayed the significance of the move.

The woman, Andie, was getting into her car when she noticed a figure in the distance moving towards her. The young man looked nice, well dressed. He called to her, but she couldn’t make out his words. Andie’s stomach twinged. She had been raised to be polite and helpful, but the knot in her stomach tightened. She shut the car door and drove away. Later, she learned that the next woman to enter that quiet car park was brutally attacked.\nBiddulph is a psychologist, known for his bestselling parenting books Raising Boys and Raising Girls. In his latest book, though, he has turned his attention to the human race in general and, in particular, to the tiny clench in Andie’s stomach that overrode her conditioning and gave her the right answer. Fully Human is a paean to what Biddulph calls “supersense”: the ability of our bodies to make our deepest feelings known to us – and of our brains to process these twinges and flutters into a simple “yes” or “no”.\n Continue reading...",

Did finance require flesh-and-blood humans?\nBeunza had studied bank trading floors for two decades, and had noticed a paradox. Digital technologies had entered finance in the late 20th century, pushing markets into cyberspace and enabling most financial work to be done outside the office – in theory. “For $1,400 a month you can have the [Bloomberg] machine at home. You can have the best information, all the data at your disposal,” Beunza was told in 2000 by the head of one Wall Street trading desk, whom he called “Bob”.

At 74, she has lived a full, eventful life, though she will be for ever remembered for an event that took up little more than one minute of it, on the night of 27 March 1973. This was when she took the stage at the 45th Academy Awards to speak on behalf of Marlon Brando, who had been awarded best actor for his performance in The Godfather. It is still a striking scene to watch.

This year, however, Hong Kong authorities banned the vigil for the second consecutive year, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Critics say the authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to silence pro-democracy voices. Last year thousands of people gathered in Victoria Park despite the ban, and weeks later police arrested more than 20 activists who had taken part in the vigil. Organisers have urged people to mark the anniversary in private this year by lighting a candle at home\n Continue reading...",

Martin Chulov describes a man who came back from the brink of defeat to strengthen his grip on a country deeply scarred by war\nBashar al-Assad succeeded his father as president of Syria in 2000. He was just 34, had studied in London, and some hoped he would open up the autocratic country. Instead, following the Arab spring uprising he has cracked down harder than ever on the Syrian people. In the decade-long civil war that followed, more than 500,000 people are thought to have died. \nThe Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, tells Anushka Asthana that as Assad lost control of vast areas of Syria following the uprising, he was at maximum vulnerability. But the intervention of Iran and Russia proved decisive. Now, after a widely discredited election victory with 95% of the vote, Assad begins his fourth term as president of a country deeply scarred by war. \n Continue reading...",

Can widespread public opposition overcome huge commercial pressure to go ahead?\nWhen Tokyo’s bid to host the Olympics succeeded eight years ago, a supportive public expected the 2020 Games to be a moment of national unity – and, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, a declaration that the country was open for business. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic forced a delay to 2021.\nWith the rearranged Games due to take place in less than two months the expected respite from the pandemic has not materialised, and with vaccination rates in Japan stubbornly low, polls suggest that as much as 80% of the public wants to see them postponed again or even called off. Justin McCurry, the Guardian’s Tokyo correspondent, tells Anushka Asthana why the movement to cancel the Games is facing an uphill battle in the face of vast financial pressure to go ahead.\n Continue reading...",
