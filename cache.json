          "description": "Making it even harder to claim asylum will do nothing to prevent tragedies such as the drowning of a baby\nThe identification of the body of Artin Iran Nezhad in Norway brings a tragic migration story to an end. Artin, aged 15 months when his Iranian Kurdish parents tried to cross the Channel in a small boat, was reported missing when the vessel sank near Dunkirk last October and the rest of the family died. Since New Year’s Day, when a baby’s remains were found near Karmøy, forensic scientists have worked to identify them. This week it was announced that Artin’s body will be flown back to relatives in Iran for burial.\nLike the photograph of Alan Kurdi’s lifeless body being lifted from the sea by a police officer in Turkey six years ago, the tale of a dead baby lost for months at sea is filled with pathos. What more graphic illustration could there be of the extreme risks taken by desperate migrants than the loss of the tiny children they would doubtless have done everything in their power to protect?\n Continue reading...",

This was a specific flavor of irritation.” To the character, Amanda, it is merely an inconvenience. But the reader already understands that something is very wrong. The sudden severance of communications is ominous.\nThe novel gained an eerie sense of prescience by being published in the middle of the pandemic. Similarly, Tuesday’s massive internet outage, which saw news and other hugely popular sites around the world vanish, was perhaps more disconcerting for a public primed by Covid to the abrupt disruption of things we took for granted. The Guardian, the New York Times, the BBC, the Financial Times, CNN and Le Monde were all hit, along with internet behemoth Amazon, the Gov.uk site in Britain, PayPal and Reddit.

When Russia invaded Afghanistan in 1979, for instance, one unintended consequence was a rise in heroin addiction and drug-related crime in Toxteth, Croxteth and Bootle. Raff, a former heroin dealer of Pakistani heritage, explains that, at the time, the Afghan mujahideen needed money for arms and so increased opium production.\nEntrepreneurs such as Raff saw a business opportunity, while addicts in the Liverpool 8 postcode saw a cheap way of escaping reality. Heroin hit the streets at £5 a bag. Addicts recalled how the drug made them feel safe and untouchable – desirable commodities when graffiti on tumbledown walls read “Welcome to Thatcher’s Beirut”, unemployment soared and Toxteth burned during the 1981 riots.\n Continue reading...",

But pensioners are harder for the party to reach\nRead much commentary about electoral politics in Britain and you’ll quickly come across an inescapable narrative. What’s distinctive about the current moment, it goes, is that the Conservatives are the new party of the working class in England, while Labour’s electorate has been reduced to a rump of the city-dwelling, middle-class and “woke”. The crumbling of the “red wall” in the 2019 general election, and the recent Conservative triumph in the Hartlepool byelection, has elevated this myth to a near political religion.\nThere are figures in Labour who have uncritically swallowed this narrative, largely for factional reasons: in the party’s forever-war, portraying the left flank as bourgeois dilettantes who never left the student debating chamber is a convenient rhetorical device. It is, however, a deceit. As recent analysis underlined, in 2019, Labour won a higher share of the working-age population than the Tories; excluding retirees, it had a decisive lead with low-income workers and indeed triumphed in every income bracket except for those earning more than £100,000 a year. The Tories secured victory thanks to pensioners, who comprise a quarter of the electorate and are most likely to vote.\n Continue reading...",

Janet is devastated when an internet date stands her up: “He took one look at me and ran off because I’m fat and ugly,” she sobs. “You’re not ugly,” quips her glam best friend Diana (Lucy Pinder), always ready to knock Janet’s self-confidence. The world lays indignities upon Janet and then film throws on some more. The character is so thinly written that there’s little for Clayton to do other than perform her with a kind of mouth-open gormlessness.\nMost of the film is set at an annoyingly anachronistic holiday camp in Rhyl where the two friends go on holiday for a week. Diana gives Janet a makeover for the trip; transforming her into Jeanette De Brun (“It’s French, dead classy,” she reasons). The comedy here is meant to be affectionate social satire, I think. But it feels snidey: a mickey-take of working-class characters hilariously mispronouncing “Tenerife” and “Les Misérables”.\n Continue reading...",

When it looked like they might succeed, Dumba and her owners disappeared \n\nOne day in late September 2020, the Kludsky family – Yvonne, a slim, blond woman in her 60s, her husband, George, who is over 80 but still fit and strong, and their son Martyn – led their elephant up a ramp into the 10-metre trailer that constituted her second home. Dumba went willingly, as always; it was her owners who dragged their feet. The family had spent much of their lives on the road, but this time they did not know how long they would be gone, or if they would ever return.\nThe Kludskys’ home is on the outskirts of Caldes de Montbui, a spa town north of Barcelona. Set amid farmland and hills, the property forms part of a secluded residential development. Until recently, they had spent at least half of the year, travelling across Europe with Dumba, performing in circuses and zoos or hiring her out for media work – including a TV ad in which she lumbered gracefully across a mattress to demonstrate the product’s durability (“A Pikolin can take anything”). Yvonne, whose professional name is Yvonne Kruse, is a fourth-generation circus performer, while George is sixth-generation circus, and they have worked with Dumba for 41 years, since she was brought to Europe from Asia at the age of two. “She is our daughter and we are her herd,” Kruse likes to say.\n Continue reading...",

But those who love ultrarunning insist it can be safe – and has changed how they see the world. What keeps them coming back?\nTo most people, the horror of 21 lives being lost during a race across 100km in a Chinese mountain range will have been amplified by how obscure the sport seems to outsiders. But ultrarunning has boomed in popularity in recent years, with the number of finishers around the world rising from 120,000 to more than 600,000 in a decade. Now there are concerns that in China and beyond, a proliferation of new races has created a risk that safety rules will not always be enforced, and with it a chance that some of the most obsessive participants will discard vital protective equipment in the interests of gaining an advantage over their rivals.\nRachel Humphreys talks to Outside magazine’s Will Ford about the tragedy in China, and whether the decision of the government there to ban all extreme sports is the right response. And she hears from the author and ultrarunner Adharanand Finn about the extraordinary appeal of this brutally difficult feat of endurance – and how any analysis of its dangers must sit alongside an understanding of its power to change its devotees’ lives in profound ways.\n Continue reading...",

He tells Anushka Asthana that the last year has highlighted the reluctance of some participants in the culture war over statues to grapple with the reality of Britain’s history. And, he argues, even figures of civil rights heroes such as Nelson Mandela and Rosa Parks misrepresent their role in bringing about social change – and underplay the crucial significance of the movements that lifted them up.\n Continue reading...",

Find out how two women in the public eye cope when anxiety affects their skin – and discover the science behind the spots\nSpots, rashes and flushing can often affect your emotions, making you self-conscious or even embarrassed. But did you know that, conversely, heightened emotions can aggravate your skin, making it vulnerable to breakouts – and that this is scientifically recognised?\n“It’s been shown, on a molecular level, that there are changes to the chemicals in the skin when we get stressed,” says consultant dermatologist Dr Justine Hextall. “The blood vessels dilate and then you often get a flushed red face.” Stress will change the skin barrier, the outer layer of skin cells and the ceramides, cholesterols and fatty acids that hold them together, making inflammation more likely.\n Continue reading...",
