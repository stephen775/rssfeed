 1.22am BST 
Bubba’s left with a 55-footer for eagle. He very nearly drains it. Birdie will do. He’s level par. Another magnificent putt, on the par-three 16th by Louis Oosthuizen, who guides in a 20-foot left-to-right slider for a birdie that brings him up to -1.
 1.18am BST 
One of the shots of the day by Bubba Watson. Driver off the deck at the monster par-five 9th. He sets it out miles right, then cuts it back into the heart of the green. He spins in delight as someone, with classic cowboy yeehaw intonation, yells Bub-buh! from the gallery. Even in the DeChambeau era, there’s nobody quite like Bubba.

Israel has launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip for a second time since a shaky ceasefire ended last month’s 11-day war.
The strikes late on Thursday came after activists mobilised by Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers launched incendiary balloons into Israel for a third day running. The balloons are basic devices intended to set fire to farmland and bush surrounding the Gaza enclave.

Hospitals in England and Wales undertook almost 1.6m fewer operations last year because of the pandemic, including on people who needed emergency and urgent surgery, a study shows.
People with cancer will die as a result of having to wait for care while the delays will leave other patients less likely to improve after treatment, the researchers say.

Britain’s economic recovery will accelerate into the autumn despite the threat from staff shortages and higher inflation, according to a forecast by the business lobby group, the CBI.
The economy will expand by 8.2% this year and by 6.1% next year as the successful vaccination programme allows lockdown easing to continue next month, driving a surge in consumer spending and business activity in the second half of 2021, the CBI said.

Brexit checks, stockpiling and Covid have been blamed for much of the downturn, but the sector has said the figures show structural rather than teething problems with the UK’s departure from the EU.

Urgent moves are under way to prevent the American 1500m star Shelby Houlihan running in the US Olympic trials this weekend after she was given permission to compete despite a four-year doping ban.
Multiple sources have told the Guardian that pressure is growing on USA Track and Field (Ustaf) to reverse its decision. Those sources expect sense to prevail and that Houlihan – who was banned by the court of arbitration for sport after testing positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone, which she blamed on eating meat from a burrito van – will be stopped from attending the trials.

The Covid documentaries have been coming thick and fast. We have had films recorded in real time from doctors. We have had thoughtful overviews that piece together our and other countries’ responses with the benefit of hindsight. Earlier this week, we had a Horizon special on the development of the vaccines that may, without hyperbole, save the world.
Art, however, takes longer. The factual programming has been, almost without exception, terrifically good: sober, meticulous, grappling with vast amounts of data and dramatic footage and wrestling it into comprehensible, valuable forms for an exhausted, bewildered and lay audience. It has informed us, brilliantly. But it is art, the stories we tell ourselves about extraordinary and frequently traumatic experiences, that helps us come to terms with them. Dennis Kelly’s Together (BBC Two) may be the first major work for a mass audience that succeeds in this task.

Ministers have apologised unreservedly to rape victims, saying they are “deeply ashamed” that thousands of survivors have been failed on the government’s watch, as they pledged an overhaul of the criminal justice system.
A long-awaited government review into a precipitous decline in rape prosecutions promises sweeping reform of how cases are handled in England and Wales, including targets for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police to increase the number of prosecutions, and plans to shift the focus of investigations from the victim’s credibility to the perpetrator.

Frank de Boer entered Euro 2020 much maligned for his deployment of a 3-5-2, scepticism that was hardly eased by a wobbly opening victory. Yet following a win built on the rock-solid Matthijs de Ligt in defence, De Boer’s men have given him the best riposte: six points from six, which also means that players can be rested when North Macedonia visit on Monday.
Temperatures in the high 20s made this a sultry evening for a contest in which De Ligt’s return from injury was key. De Boer’s system suddenly appeared rounded, the Juventus man’s ability to sense danger and kill it pulling the standard of the rearguard up towards the convincing quality of the Netherlands in attack.

Perhaps this wasn’t the game for making proper judgments. Belgium were in the desperately awkward position of being the other team in the face of a great outpouring of Danish emotion, and for half the game they struggled in that role. But the introduction of Kevin De Bruyne, back after surgery on the facial injury he sustained in the Champions League final, changed everything.
But beyond talk of the difficult emotion of the occasion or of De Bruyne’s brilliance, there are other issues for Belgium. Going forward after half-time, they looked like the side that had scored 40 goals in qualifying. Romelu Lukaku, the isolation of the first half ended, was exceptional. But that first half exposed major concerns about the defence: the foundations are creaking.

Channel 4 could be sold off as soon as next year, with the government planning to launch a formal consultation into the broadcaster’s privatisation within weeks.
Last month, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, confirmed it may move to privatise Channel 4 by the end of the current parliament to “provide a sustainable future for the broadcaster”, but on Thursday the Financial Times reported that a decision could be made by the end of this year.

A quick browse through the daily newspapers on the morning of that game offers just a taste of the hope, fear, giddy expectation and casual jingoism that greeted the first tournament meeting between international football’s oldest rivals.

Churchill College has halted a critical examination of its founder, Winston Churchill, by abruptly ending the role of a working party set up last year in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.
Initially intended as a year-long programme called “Churchill, race and empire”, the Cambridge college has ended the effort after a dispute between the college’s leadership and the working party, whose members had been planning a mass resignation over what it called interference in a planned event.

Hurrah, Deliveroo’s float flop didn’t kill the appetite for tech listings in London. Actually, the gloomy theory always looked far-fetched. Investors are capable of distinguishing between a loss-making fast food delivery firm in a highly competitive field and Wise, formerly TransferWise, a profitable Shoreditch-based operation that is already a threat to big banks’ price-gouging practices in the cross-border money transfer game.
Wise’s arrival is different in another way. The innovation – or new feature for the London market, at least – is a “direct listing” model. In short, the company is not raising new capital so there are no new shares to be marketed and then priced. Willing sellers among existing shareholders will simply be given the chance to meet willing buyers, thereby creating a market.

Racing history was denied in emphatic fashion at Royal Ascot when Stradivarius, the usually mighty chestnut, finished a disappointing fourth and missed out on becoming only the second horse to win the Gold Cup four times. In a strangely misjudged race by the normally masterly Frankie Dettori, the jockey and Stradivarius suffered. Stuck in heavy traffic on the rail at the home turn, they struggled to find the space to have a sustained crack at the impressive Subjectivist, who streaked home to win by five lengths.
Stradivarius was almost 10 lengths behind with three furlongs to run and, from that position, victory already looked unlikely for even a great horse. A damp squib of a race for the favourite was sealed when, while making a late surge to close the gap on Subjectivist, Stradivarius and Dettori succumbed and were also beaten home by Princess Zoe and Spanish Mission.

It was not quite Gerald Ratner talking jewellery or Colin Graves discussing the T20 Blast but you could almost sense the organisers wincing when Virat Kohli downplayed the significance of the inaugural World Test Championship final that begins on Friday.
Speaking 24 hours out from the game in Southampton, in which India take on New Zealand after a two-year cycle that was nearly derailed by the pandemic, Kohli was asked whether this was the biggest Test match of a career already assured of its place in history.
“No, for me this is another Test match that has to be played,” Kohli replied. “I think these things are very exciting from the outside, where there is so much importance and so much extra stuff attached to one game. It sort of becomes do or die.

Dominic Cummings launched a lurid attack this week on the “chronic dysfunction” and incompetence in the government’s pandemic handling, singling out the health secretary, Matt Hancock, for most criticism. While few would want to rely solely on an account from Boris Johnson’s controversial former aide, some of it quickly contested, there is plentiful evidence of the government’s failures.
There is no doubt its performance has improved. With Covid cases in the UK now doubling every 11 days, the vaccination push is intensifying; all over-18s can book for theirs from Friday. The speed of the rollout has helped to break the link between infections and deaths. The delay of a further relaxation of restrictions was a welcome and necessary decision. But the Delta variant’s rapid spread has meant that hospitalisations are up 15% week on week, and deaths 10%.

Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party was originally a party of protest. Founded in 1971 by Ian Paisley, it stood for no surrender. It opposed every attempt by successive British governments to build power-sharing institutions, including the Good Friday agreement in 1998. Then, in 2007, the DUP decided to be a party of power, with Mr Paisley becoming Northern Ireland’s first minister. Since then, it has been the main party of government, first under Mr Paisley, then Peter Robinson and, until last month, Arlene Foster. But, under Edwin Poots, the DUP reverted to being a protest party once more.
Mr Poots’s ousting of Mrs Foster was essentially an act of bloodletting between the free presbyterian base of the original Paisleyite party and the DUP’s less doctrinaire members. Some of the latter, alienated by Mrs Foster’s mistakes over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol, had already drifted away. But the ousting was a coup without a strategy for winning such voters back; it will lead to further defections. Instead, Mr Poots doubled down on the old religion. His priority was to redirect the party, not to govern Northern Ireland. On Thursday night that effort imploded and Mr Poots had to quit.

The president of Zambia from 1964 to 1991, Kenneth Kaunda, who has died aged 97, stood out as one of the most humane and idealistic African leaders in the post-independence age. A man of great presence and charm, he played a notable role as a leader of the “frontline states” in the long confrontation between independent black Africa and the white-dominated south of the continent, which came to an end only in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa. 
He was a consummate politician and spent much of his time shuffling his top party figures around in a chess game to balance ethnic groups and their claims to power-sharing; he also possessed a ruthless streak which he deployed towards opponents, although his abhorrence of violence was a rarity in that era.

There should be an inquiry into inquiries. They are institutionally corrupt. The latest, the fifth into the 1987 Daniel Morgan murder, justified itself this week with 1,200 pages and the headline-grabbing epithet “institutional”. We are no nearer the truth of this single unsolved killing, and the home secretary has merely announced another inquiry into police oversight. For this the nation has waited 24 years and spent £30m. It is a scandal.

The main focus ahead of the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on Friday has understandably been on the head-to-head between Mother Earth and Empress Josephine, the 1,000 Guineas winners in England and Ireland respectively.
Both have obvious claims, while Pretty Gorgeous, who floundered on heavy ground behind Empress Josephine at the Curragh, will also appreciate quicker going, but Novemba, the German 1,000 Guineas winner, has crept into the race almost unnoticed.

Françoise Hardy, the French pop songwriter who found fame in the 60s yé-yé movement, has said she feels “close to the end” of her life in a new interview.
Hardy, 77, told Femme Actuelle that in 2018 she was diagnosed with a tumour in her ear. It followed her diagnosis with lymphatic cancer in the mid-2000s, and a hospitalisation in 2015 that led to her being placed in an induced coma. Her life was saved when doctors administered a novel form of radiation.

It’s a no-brainer, isn’t it? Of course every care and NHS worker should be vaccinated against Covid and anything else that puts them and their patients at risk. Those who remember people who had contracted polio at school with leg irons or paralysed arms know how to thank modern medicine for our salvation.
Facts, scientific facts, that’s the dose the vaccine-refusers need. Or so every good rationalist believes. But why do we never learn our lessons? Look where that facts-based approach got us remainers in the Brexit referendum. Humans don’t live by reason alone – maybe scarcely at all. And our government knows it, ruling by raw emotion and focus group, guided by what people feel regardless of truth. It leaves the very sensible Labour opposition flailing.

You can relax now. A saviour has risen from these streets. Thanks to the UK-Australian free trade agreement announced on Tuesday – the first such deal to be negotiated from scratch since Brexit – the country’s gross domestic product will increase by 0.02% over the next 15 years. Just another 250 or so similarly hugely advantageous deals to be struck to offset the loss in GDP following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.
Not that Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, chose to dwell on any of the possible downsides when she made her statement on the Australian deal in the Commons. Rather, she was keen to parade the agreement that had been concluded by Boris Johnson and the Aussie prime minister, Scott Morrison, in just about an hour over a boozy lunch in Downing Street as the gold standard by which all future trade deals should be measured.

While we endure life under this chaotic and cynical government, we can at least rely on liberal and progressive journalists to scrutinise and challenge it. But one line of attack in the Tories’ culture war not only gets a free pass, it is actively aided and abetted by a vocal minority on the left. I refer to the government’s assault on the freedoms and safety of its transgender citizens.
Some loud lefties, under the guise of “gender-critical feminism”, are in lockstep with a government that they would otherwise denounce. The successors to what was known as “trans-exclusionary radical feminism” now agree with Tory ministers that trans people should not have equal rights and, in fact, have too many already.

The Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi should have been identified as a security threat on the night of the attack, a public inquiry has found.
Sir John Saunders, chair of the inquiry, found there were “serious shortcomings” and a number of missed opportunities by those in charge of security to prevent the May 2017 attack. Saunders said he considered it likely Abedi would still have detonated his device if confronted, “but the loss of life and injury is highly likely to have been less”. The attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.

Tottenham have opened talks with Gennaro Gattuso after their move to appoint Paulo Fonseca broke down in the latest blow to their search for a manager.
Fonseca, a former Roma and Shakhtar Donetsk manager, had been expected to sign after a contract was verbally agreed. Sources close to him said the deal collapsed because of issues relating to tax that became apparent to Fonseca in the past 48 hours. Italian law provided him with tax breaks that do not apply in the UK and he wanted his pay adjusted accordingly.

To date, more than 5,600 people have shared their experience of child sexual abuse with the Truth Project; each one makes a vital contribution to the inquiry’s work and helps it to make recommendations. Victims and survivors who have taken part have been able to tell the inquiry how institutions have failed them, and explain what needs to change in order to better protect children in the future. Many have told us they felt empowered by coming forward to the Truth Project, with some saying it was a real turning point in their life.

Coronavirus – latest updates

AstraZeneca can charge a higher price for its Covid-19 vaccine in dozens of poor countries once the pharmaceutical company decides the pandemic has ended, according to a copy of its contract with Oxford University seen by the Guardian.
The British-Swedish drug firm has promised to provide the vaccine at a not-for-profit price to the developing world in perpetuity, but a review of a redacted version of its contract with Oxford University – obtained by the student advocacy group Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) – found that the promise excludes many low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

Previous infection with coronavirus does not necessarily protect against Covid in the longer term, especially when caused by new variants of concern, a study on healthcare workers suggests.
Researchers at Oxford University found marked differences in the immune responses of medical staff who contracted Covid, with some appearing far better equipped than others to combat the disease six months later.

With the approach of the summer holidays, the two French seaside towns of Saint-Valery-sur-Somme and Le Crotoy would normally be gearing up for the annual wave of tourists from neighbouring Belgium and, above all, from the UK.
The resorts sit opposite each other across the majestic Bay of the Somme, a wetland of shifting sands and tides where the tranquil river suddenly expands into a spectacular estuary opening up into the Channel. The bay is a popular stop-off for British travellers heading to Paris and the south of France, as well as a place of pilgrimage for its war memorials, museums, cemeteries and battle sites.

Apple Daily’s journalism has ruffled feathers since its establishment in 1995. A populist Hong Kong tabloid owned by Jimmy Lai, a pro-Trump media mogul and now jailed activist, the paper is fond of sensational crime stories, celebrity gossip, and investigations into government scandals and corruption. It’s a vocal supporter of the pro-democracy movement, a thorn in the side of police, and has become a symbol of resistance against Hong Kong’s crackdown.
Hong Kong’s police commissioner has accused it of creating hatred. Pro-Beijing media have called for it to be shut down. Lai has said the paper is on the right side of history.

Like everyone, I had two main criticisms of last month’s Friends reunion special. The first is that, after almost 30 years of watching the cast suspended in the throes of perfect youth, the sight of their weird, cosmetically altered faces in HD came as such a shock that I would have preferred it to be called something like All Things Decay: A Harrowing Reminder That Everything We Love Will One Day Be Dead. The second is that James Corden didn’t make it enough about him.
Oh, sure, he made it plenty about him. He hosted the thing, despite having no tangible connection to Friends. And, yes, when the cast came on, he spoke for more than two minutes before bothering to ask them a question. But did he make it about himself, in a truly Cordenesque way? No, he did not.

Speaking to Collider in the run-up to the release of the standalone Black Widow film, Johansson said: “While [Iron Man 2] was really fun and had a lot of great moments in it, the character is so sexualised, you know? [She is] really talked about like she’s a piece of something, like a possession or a thing or whatever – like a piece of ass, really. And Tony even refers to her as something like that at one point … ‘I want some.’”

A few weeks ago, a restaurant in London’s King’s Cross emailed its regular customers, with a special offer. It wasn’t the standard come-hither promotion: a free glass of fizz or two main courses for the price of one. It was a £100 voucher for anybody who recommended a new employee who then went on to work for them for at least a month. Around the same time the Manchester Evening News reported that the city’s hospitality staff were in such short supply that pub and restaurant operators were aggressively attempting to poach key employees off each other. A recent survey of hundreds of businesses by industry body UK Hospitality has found that more than 80% have vacancies both front and back of house. The message is clear: as it emerges from the pandemic, the beleaguered restaurant sector has a serious staffing problem.
Most restaurants, weighed down by the rutted dysfunction of the British economy, cling to financial viability by their fingertips

Paul Whiteman is the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers

It seems to have escaped government ministers’ notice, but running a school is a complex task. I say this because over the last 18 months, schools in England have been dancing on the head of a pin, reacting to government guidance that has changed and changed again, often overnight, with little regard for how it will be implemented in real life.
For all the difficulties that the pandemic has brought us, school leaders have told me that it is not Covid that has been their biggest headache, but the constantly changing expectations of the government.

Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas – mostly in critical infrastructure - that are “off limits” for cyber-attacks.

Nobody can tell Brenda Myers-Powell’s story better than Brenda herself. It’s what she has been doing since escaping 25 years of abuse and sexual exploitation to transform herself into a beacon of hope and compassion for women in desperate circumstances.
Now 63, she is the co-founder of the Dreamcatcher Foundation, a US-based non-profit set up in 2008 to fight human-trafficking in the Chicago area, and the vivacious, multiple wig-sporting star of an acclaimed 2015 documentary about her work, also called Dreamcatcher. In late June, her memoir, Leaving Breezy Street, will be published in the UK, and a film adaption is already on the cards.

The last time Fochik Hashtali* spoke with her close friend Poe Jackson, he was telling her about his plans to start a mental health group for transgender people in Slab City, a section of southern California known for its community of squatters.
It was a Saturday evening in April and the 21-year-old, who identified as Two Spirit, a term typically used to distinguish members of the Native LGBTQ+ community, had just moved to the area, according to Hashtali.
After a childhood in Tennessee spent dealing with poverty and bullying, he had traveled to the encampment in the hopes of being accepted for who he was, Hashtali explained. Jackson, a Wyandot descendent, told Hashtali that he wanted to help people heal, “do art, calm down, talk about trauma healthily”.
One month later, law enforcement recovered Jackson’s body from the Coachella Canal, near Slab City, and ruled his death a homicide.
“I couldn’t believe it,” said Hashtali.
“I was like a train wreck. I cried myself to sleep that night”.

Support our journalism from as little as £1

Sportswriting is, among many other things, a terrific ego trip. Perhaps all forms of journalism are in their own way. But there’s something about the purity and the passion that sport generates: that vast reservoir of emotion and yearning you’re tapping into, the buzz of a full arena when you enter it for the first time, plastic lanyard clacking around your neck, complimentary programme (retail price: £8) tucked underneath your arm. Put it this way: to be a sportswriter you don’t have to be a narcissistic, thrill-seeking freeloader hooked on the dopamine of likes and retweets and the kick of seeing your name in print. But, um, it doesn’t necessarily hurt.
Then again, when you work somewhere as renowned as the Guardian, you are frequently reminded that your fragile self-esteem is built on the labours and love of others. The page designer who fits your words perfectly into a pre-assigned slot and surrounds it with pictures and fancy graphics. The subeditor who gets in touch shortly before deadline to politely point out it is generally customary for sentences to contain a verb. The web publishers and social media bods who make sure your article will actually be seen. The in-house lawyers who make sure you haven’t accidentally libelled Roman Abramovich.

Bangor pier holds many memories for us. It’s the place where my husband lost his car keys 50 years ago. Luckily those were the days when you could hotwire a car (or in this case minivan) to start it. We return there often. The pier has breathtaking views of the Menai straits on one side and to the Great Orme behind Llandudno on the other. In front is beautiful Anglesey; turn round for wonderful views of Snowdonia. It is a pier that is unrivalled anywhere. It has refreshments and ice-cream too!

There is a lot of joy in little glimmers of normality these days. For Jo Whiley’s sister, Frances, this includes being able to go back to bingo. “It means the world to her,” says Whiley, the BBC Radio 2 DJ. “And she won £30 last week, which was like she’d won a trillion pounds; she was so happy!” It was only in February that Frances was admitted to hospital with Covid and her family were told to prepare for the worst.
It was something the whole family had been dreading since the start of the pandemic. Frances has cri du chat syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause significant learning disabilities and has other health issues such as diabetes. For the national lockdown in March 2020, Frances moved from her care home in Northamptonshire to her parents’ house. But when she moved back into residential care a few months later, the idea of the virus infecting the residents, says Whiley, was “your worst nightmare. I would speak to a lot of other people who had children or siblings in care homes and we were all thinking the same thing – that we were petrified of Covid getting into the homes.”

Salps are jelly-like sea creatures, so humble that few people even know they exist. But there are countless numbers of them swimming in the world’s oceans and they help fight climate change.
Salps cruise around the sea surface at night, sucking up and digesting phytoplankton, microscopic plant-like organisms that absorb CO2 for their photosynthesis. During the day, the salps sink deeper in the sea, possibly to avoid predators, and squirt out unusually heavy droppings rich in carbon left over from their phytoplankton meals. The pellets sink rapidly, up to 1,000 metres deep in a day, and faster than the pellets of most other sea creatures. And when the salp dies, its body also sinks rapidly, sending even more carbon to the ocean depths.

Seb had been compliant with the arresting officers, but he had given the impression that he was unconcerned by what had happened – it seemed as though he didn’t mind at all that he was being arrested. More bizarrely, there were flickers of apparent self-satisfaction. Seb had been arrested on suspicion of murdering his mother.

To call Natalie Wynn a YouTuber seems like a terrible understatement. On a platform awash in makeup tutorials, guys playing video games, horrible comedy and conspiracy theorists, Wynn – whose YouTube channel is called ContraPoints – is someone truly original: a provocateuse, a video essayist and a warrior against the alt-right in ways you would never expect.
Her videos are political in nature but feel like theater, involving many costume changes and references to philosophers and academic texts. She can switch from discussing Taylor Swift to Wittgenstein with the snap of a fan. Sharp and funny, she’s a comedian who wields her wit in the service of exposing bigotry and making people examine their own biases.

Guardian reporter Adam Gabbatt tells Anushka Asthana that in recent years a series of government videos showing unidentified objects have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong object flying through the sky near San Diego in 2004. The wave of recent videos and the imminent release of the government report has ignited excitement around unidentified flying objects not seen for years.

More than half of European cities are still plagued by dirty air, new data shows, despite a reduction in traffic emissions and other pollutants during last year’s lockdowns.
Cities in eastern Europe, where coal is still a major source of energy, fared worst of all, with Nowy Sącz in Poland having the most polluted air, followed by Cremona in Italy where industry and geography tend to concentrate air pollution, and Slavonski Brod in Croatia.

Six climate activists and two environmental NGOs have taken Norway to the European court of human rights (ECHR), arguing the Nordic country’s plans to drill for oil in the Arctic are harming young people’s futures.
The activists, Greenpeace and Young Friends of the Earth, want the court to rule that Oslo’s 2016 decision to grant 10 Barents Sea oil exploration licences violated article 112 of Norway’s constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment.

The UK government is failing to protect people from the fast-rising risks of the climate crisis, from deadly heatwaves to power blackouts, its official climate advisers have warned.
The climate change committee said action to improve the nation’s resilience is not keeping pace with the impacts of global heating, many of which are already causing harm. The CCC’s experts said they were frustrated by the “absolutely illogical” lack of sufficient action on adaptation, particularly as acting is up to 10 times more cost-effective than not doing so.

Israel’s longest-serving leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, was ousted from office on Sunday by a coalition of rival parties from across the political spectrum. Yair Lapid, a centrist former TV news anchor, won a confidence vote in parliament by 60 to 59 seats giving the new coalition a razor-thin majority.
The Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent, Oliver Holmes, tells Rachel Humphreys that Netanyahu’s downfall was marked by jubilant celebrations from his political opponents. But the new coalition of eight parties is far from stable. Dahlia Scheindlin tells Rachel that despite the momentous week in Israeli politics it may not produce a significant change of course on the biggest issues facing the country. And it may not be the last act for Netanyahu in Israeli politics.

An attempt by the Colombian government to introduce sweeping tax changes in response to the coronavirus crisis was met earlier this year by angry protests. Thousands of people flooded on to the streets throughout the country for four consecutive days. It was enough to prompt President Iván Duque to withdraw his tax plans, but by then it was too late to stop the protests. 
Ever since, more and more Colombians have been coming out to protest. Joe Parkin Daniels, who has been reporting on the demonstrations for the Guardian for weeks, tells Rachel Humphreys that they now encompass people from all sections of Colombian society, with a multitude of causes. One thing ever present is a fury at the growing inequality that has been exacerbated by the Covid crisis. As police have cracked down hard on the protesters, more than 50 people have died, with no end to the protests in sight.

For geologist Lucy Crane, retrofitting the 1960s property she has just moved into is all about future-proofing. Just a minute’s walk from the Cornish coast near Pendennis Castle in Falmouth, the two-bedroom house is hot as a greenhouse during the day and cold at night – plus there’s no central heating, just a few storage heaters.
“It would be madness for us to put in a gas boiler when we need to be moving away from fossil fuels,” says Crane, who is expecting her first child with her partner Alex, a naval officer.

“I have learned something good from the Covid-19 lockdown,” says Prof Mohamed Pourkashanian. “I used to travel maybe twice a month to meetings abroad, and once or twice to meetings around the UK – but I have realised that 80% of what I did there, I can do online. That reduced need to travel will have an impact in terms of carbon reduction.”
Currently the head of University Energy Research at the University of Sheffield, in his 35 years working in the field, Pourkashanian has contributed to hundreds of papers on subjects including solar power, grid-scale batteries and carbon capture.

From 2030, new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned in Britain – a sure sign that we’re on the threshold of a transport revolution. But what exactly will this revolution look like? With estimates that the market for autonomous vehicles could be worth almost £42bn in just over a decade, the future of transport looks to be anything but boring. Here are five things you need to know …
Driverless cars take to the roads
While fully autonomous vehicles (where the driver could, in theory, watch a film while the vehicle takes the controls) are still a way off, the first driverless cars – with automated lane-keeping systems that allow drivers to safely take their hands off the wheel – could be on Britain’s roads this year. In Japan, Toyota is building its own smart city, which will function in part as a giant testing facility for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in the US, Waymo – which grew out of Google’s self-driving car project – is trialling driverless “robotaxi” services for the public in parts of Phoenix. The road to the driverless future may still be a little bumpy, but it is showing signs of smoothing out.

Well, as new technologies are helping us unlock more of the sun’s energy, the hope is that it will be key to our greener future. Here are five things you need to know about solar energy …
900,000 buildings in the UK have solar panels
The number of homes in Britain that have solar panels on the roof is heading towards one million and, if more of us sign up, solar energy could seriously boost Britain’s efforts to switch away from coal-fired power stations. The Solar Trade Association says that if 4.4m British homes were equipped with solar panels and battery set-ups, this could eliminate the evening surge in electricity demand on a winter’s day, reducing consumption at peak times by 97% annually.
