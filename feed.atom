The US Senate has overwhelmingly approved a bill to boost American semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing international competition, most notably from China.
The 68-32 vote for the bill on Tuesday demonstrates how confronting China economically is an issue that unites both parties in Congress. It is a rare unifying issue in an era of division as pressure grows on Democrats to change Senate rules to push past Republican opposition and gridlock.

In a modest conference room near the edge of Taiwan’s Sun Moon Lake, Panu Kapamumu holds up an unwieldy A3 booklet. The home-printed document contains every known word of Thao, the language of his Indigenous tribe. Kapamumu runs his finger down the list, reading out a selection of Thao words, meanings and translations. He reads slowly and purposefully, a man in his sixties but still just a student of his mother tongue.

Members of the college’s middle common room (MCR), which is restricted to students taking postgraduate degrees, voted to take down the print, with minutes of the meeting noting that “for some students depictions of the monarch and the British monarchy represent recent colonial history”.

There’s something so distractingly and, errr, sleepily half-assed about the inert new Netflix thriller Awake that watching it is almost as much of a bore as having to then write about it. Seemingly designed purely to lazily fill the column of “If you liked Bird Box then you should also watch” there’s nothing here that hasn’t been done before and better, a film that lumbers up to the table with completely empty hands.

“Villarreal were relegated in 2012. Is that the quickest time from relegation to winning a major European trophy?” asks Paul Savage.
There were plenty of replies to this one, and the Yellow Submarines were by no means the quickest to rise from the depths. Stefano Marzaroli points out that “Milan were relegated in 1982 and seven seasons later in 1988-89 they won the European Cup”. And in Franco Baresi and Mauro Tassotti, half the fabled Milan back four, went there from the drop to winning the European Cup against Steaua Bucharest at Camp Nou.

Zverev outclasses Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 

Stefanos Tsitsipas continues to play some of the best tennis of his life. For the third consecutive major tournament he will compete for a spot in his maiden final after defeating Daniil Medvedev, the second seed, 6-3, 7-6 (3), 7-5. Tsitsipas, the fifth seed, will face another contemporary and rival, Alexander Zverev, in his second French Open semi-final.
What a difference the surface makes. Away from clay, Medvedev is an extremely difficult match-up for Tsitsipas and he held a 6-1 record as they entered the court. The Greek has historically struggled to hit through Medvedev’s immense defence on hard courts, his sole victory came against a tired opponent on the fast indoor courts of the 2019 ATP Finals in London. But this was a rare example of Tsitsipas welcoming Medvedev to his surface.

In a letter to the head of the Tokyo organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto, the BOA chair, Hugh Robertson, said Team GB athletes and staff were “doing everything possible to minimise any risk to the people of Japan” in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. He also promised the hosts that the BOA would “do everything we can to get the entire team fully vaccinated before we depart for Japan”.

The last decent rain on Banaba was more than a year ago.
Without rain, people on the isolated central Pacific island, which is part of the country of Kiribati, have been forced to rely on a desalination plant for all their water for drinking, bathing and growing crops.

Australian mining companies have paid little or no corporate income tax in Papua New Guinea despite earning hundreds of millions of dollars from their PNG operations, benefiting from a complex taxation system that experts say leaves the country’s resources sector significantly “undertaxed”.
Guardian analysis of company reports and industry data can reveal that during the past decade Australian mining giants Newcrest and St Barbara, which have huge mines in PNG, have paid no corporate income tax some years, with the companies legally using generous tax rules and accounting practices to minimise their tax burdens.

The Telegraph fire, which is burning near a district called Top-of-the-World, east of Phoenix, remained at 0% containment as of Tuesday morning, while crews made progress on the Mescal fire south-east of Globe, Arizona, now at 23% containment. No deaths or injuries have been reported so far.

MPs heard on Tuesday that Heywood’s “influential” regard for Lex Greensill and the businessman’s supply chain finance proposals had helped the wealthy financier avoid more robust scrutiny as he moved through government.

And that helped them solve the mystery of what had happened to 15-month-old Artin Iran Nezhad, who had last been seen weeks before and hundreds of miles away.

The 69-year-old Zambian jurist is described by the Institute for African Women in Law as “a bold, remarkable, and inspiring example of legal brilliance”. She is said to be fluent in Tonga, Soli, Nyanja and Bemba, with a working knowledge of French, Swahili and Lozi.

An activist investor would have been very useful at Aviva for most of the insurer’s 20-odd years of existence, frustrated shareholders will feel. Outside the banking sector, it’s hard to think of a major UK financial services company that has disappointed its investors so often, or showered such large rewards for failure on its chief executives. The share price is less than half what it was at the time of formation via a three-way merger at the turn of century.
The activist that Aviva has finally attracted is Cevian Capital, which has turned up with an £800m, or 5%, stake just at the moment when Amanda Blanc, chief executive since last July, seems to be the first boss with a decent plan.

Rishi Sunak is willing to accept a delay of up to four weeks to the final stage of England’s reopening roadmap, the Guardian understands, as the government considers extending restrictions beyond 21 June.
Ministers will continue to scrutinise data on cases and hospitalisations over the coming days, with a final decision set to be announced by the prime minister on Monday. From 21 June nightclubs are due to reopen, with the cap on wedding numbers, large-scale events and indoor mixing lifted and guidance on working from home and mask-wearing dropped.

The identification of the body of Artin Iran Nezhad in Norway brings a tragic migration story to an end. Artin, aged 15 months when his Iranian Kurdish parents tried to cross the Channel in a small boat, was reported missing when the vessel sank near Dunkirk last October and the rest of the family died. Since New Year’s Day, when a baby’s remains were found near Karmøy, forensic scientists have worked to identify them. This week it was announced that Artin’s body will be flown back to relatives in Iran for burial.
Like the photograph of Alan Kurdi’s lifeless body being lifted from the sea by a police officer in Turkey six years ago, the tale of a dead baby lost for months at sea is filled with pathos. What more graphic illustration could there be of the extreme risks taken by desperate migrants than the loss of the tiny children they would doubtless have done everything in their power to protect?

In Rumaan Alam’s apocalyptic novel Leave the World Behind, a protagonist notices a news alert warning of a major blackout: “She jabbed at it, but the application did not open, just the white screen of the thinking machine. This was a specific flavor of irritation.” To the character, Amanda, it is merely an inconvenience. But the reader already understands that something is very wrong. The sudden severance of communications is ominous.
The novel gained an eerie sense of prescience by being published in the middle of the pandemic. Similarly, Tuesday’s massive internet outage, which saw news and other hugely popular sites around the world vanish, was perhaps more disconcerting for a public primed by Covid to the abrupt disruption of things we took for granted. The Guardian, the New York Times, the BBC, the Financial Times, CNN and Le Monde were all hit, along with internet behemoth Amazon, the Gov.uk site in Britain, PayPal and Reddit. What or who was responsible?

Beggars can’t be choosers. This wasn’t the reckoning that some Tory MPs – 45 or so ordinary men and women with the crazy idea that the government should be accountable to parliament for breaking a manifesto commitment – had had in mind. But once the Speaker had, the previous day, snuffed out an attempt to force a meaningful vote on plans to reduce the UK’s overseas aid by 28%, from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income, they had been left with little other choice. An emergency debate with a token vote at the end – if anyone could be bothered – would have to do.
If Andrew Mitchell, the former secretary of state for international development and nominal leader of the rebel alliance, was disappointed at the downgrade to yesterday’s story, he didn’t let it show. There again, it’s not every day a politician gets to grab the moral high ground. He began by praising the speaker for one of the “strongest statements from the chair” that he had ever heard the previous day.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova beats Elena Rybakina 6-7 (2), 6-2, 9-7

Never before in the open era history of women’s tennis, an unpredictable sport even in regular times, had six of the final eight players at a major all been first-time quarter-finalists. Yet the pair of duels on Tuesday at the French Open between four players searching for their first semi-final was a comprehensive demonstration of its merits as all four fought tooth, nail and to the death, with Tamara Zidansek and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova emerging in extra innings to play for a spot in the final.
Earlier in the day, Zidansek, the lowly world No 85 of Slovenia who had never passed the second round of a grand slam tournament, rose to the moment against the highly favoured 33rd seed, Paula Badosa of Spain, winning 7-5, 4-6, 8-6 in a desperately tense encounter. Pavlyuchenkova, seeded 31st, followed immediately and went even further as she defeated the 21st seed, Elena Rybakina, 6-7 (2), 6-2, 9-7.

In the space of a few days, we have the England football team being booed for making an anti-racist gesture (Report, June 3) and the prime minister, a man famed for racist slurs against Muslim women, jumping to the defence of a cricketer suspended for racist and sexist “jokes” posted a decade ago (Boris Johnson joins Oliver Dowden in ECB criticism over Ollie Robinson, 7 June). Ollie Robinson really does not need friends like these.
The men who run English cricket have gifted this opportunity to Boris Johnson by their clumsy handling of the affair. Instead of banning Robinson while they investigate what he wrote as a teenager, there were other options available. What do they need to investigate anyway? He wrote some garbage, he shouldn’t have. Case over, Sherlock.

I spent much of my working life as a psychologist and psychotherapist, helping people come to terms with the uncomfortable and often painful realities of their lives and personal histories. I was therefore struck by parallels with the attitudes to our national history as deftly described by David Olusoga (‘My job is to be a historian. It’s not to make people feel good’, 7 June). The defences are similar: suppression, selective memory, denial, delusion, distortion, myth creation and, for a number of people, grandiosity. In the end, perhaps we as a nation can learn from the experience of individuals who find themselves liberated by finally facing up to difficult realities, past and present.

• David Olusoga says “my job is to be a historian. It’s not to make people feel good.” My grandson, aged 13, recently told me he’d studied the British empire at school. He didn’t like it much: “Too many atrocities!” At least his school is getting it right.

The exquisite set of Raphael tapestries currently on display in the grand gallery of Madrid’s royal palace has survived five tumultuous centuries of wars, rebellions, bombs, bullets and fire – only to find itself menaced by the more quotidian threat of opportunistic pigeons and their droppings.
The nine tapestries, which depict scenes from the Acts of the Apostles, were created in Brussels in the mid-16th century using the original sketches drawn by the Italian master whom Pope Leo X commissioned to design a set of life-size hangings to adorn the Sistine Chapel in 1514.

Britain’s housing market is “on fire” thanks to the extension of government tax breaks for homebuyers and increased demand from richer households with more savings following coronavirus lockdowns, the Bank of England’s chief economist said on Tuesday.
Andy Haldane warned that the property market was likely to continue running hot while all these factors, in combination with the central bank’s ultra-low interest rates, remained in place. He said the recent rise in house prices – which topped 10% over the 12 months to March 2021, according to official data – was very likely to worsen inequality.

Ratko Mladić, the former Bosnian Serb commander nicknamed the “butcher of Bosnia”, will spend the rest of his life in prison after a UN court dismissed his final appeal against convictions for genocide and crimes against humanity, in a judgment hailed as “historic” by the White House.
Unlike previous appearances at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, the 78-year-old showed little emotion as an hour-long reading of the judgment finally put an end to attempts to quash the charges against him.

The study by University College London and the London School of Economics found that pupils whose parents had degrees were the beneficiaries of last year’s government U-turn that replaced grades determined by an algorithm in favour of grades decided by teacher assessments.

Irish handicapper believes British may stay on back foot

Ireland’s recent dominance of National Hunt racing was underlined once again on Tuesday when the official ratings for 2020-21 revealed that six of the top eight chasers last season, and nine of the top 12 hurdlers, were from Irish stables. While there was agreement among the handicappers that Ireland’s current superiority is overwhelming, however, there was a difference of opinion on how long it is likely to endure.
Irish-trained runners swept through the Cheltenham Festival in March, winning a record 23 of the 28 races including a dozen of the 14 Grade One events, despite making up just 40% of the starters.

He heard European talk of a rules-based international order as the contemptible bleating of weakling nations.

The pandemic has brought birdsong to the ears of many people in the past year. Unlike most newly transfixed listeners, Mona Arshi, who a decade ago made the unusual transition from human rights lawyer to poet, felt an urge to transcribe the sounds.
When she wrote them down – following a path first trodden by the Northamptonshire farm worker and poet John Clare – she found that the songs of lapwings, reedwarblers and redshanks brought to mind long-forgotten Punjabi words from childhood. Lapwing called out “Kui” – “why” in Punjabi – while godwits sang “thohreh deh” – “give me a little”.

As people mark World Oceans Day today, an overwhelming 94% of people in England and Wales believe the fate of the oceans and humans are inextricably linked, while more than half rate global ocean health as “poor or very poor”, according to a government survey.
The online survey of 8,000 people, carried out for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Ocean Conservation Trust earlier this year, reveals the depth of public understanding of the link between the health of the oceans and the multiple pressures upon them.

Experts have warned that US tech companies, including Google, Amazon and Facebook, could pay less tax in the UK and several other big economies under global reforms agreed at the weekend by the G7.
In a key stumbling block emerging days after the landmark deal, research from the TaxWatch campaign group indicates that the UK Treasury stands to lose about £230m from the taxes paid each year by four of the big US tech firms.

The world is more tightly ringed with ruinous connections than we imagine. When Russia invaded Afghanistan in 1979, for instance, one unintended consequence was a rise in heroin addiction and drug-related crime in Toxteth, Croxteth and Bootle. Raff, a former heroin dealer of Pakistani heritage, explains that, at the time, the Afghan mujahideen needed money for arms and so increased opium production.
Entrepreneurs such as Raff saw a business opportunity, while addicts in the Liverpool 8 postcode saw a cheap way of escaping reality. Heroin hit the streets at £5 a bag. Addicts recalled how the drug made them feel safe and untouchable – desirable commodities when graffiti on tumbledown walls read “Welcome to Thatcher’s Beirut”, unemployment soared and Toxteth burned during the 1981 riots.

Angela Merkel’s method of winning elections has earned its own phrase among German political scientists: “asymmetric demobilisation”, the art of running a campaign that skirts around hot-button issues in order to present voters with a choice between personalities rather than policies.
Three and a half months before Germany goes to the polls, Merkel’s aspiring successor Armin Laschet seems to have taken her strategy to heart. With a campaign that has so far failed to tackle the country’s hard choices on carbon emissions, digitisation, eurozone integration and military spending, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its candidate for chancellor may get away with it too.

Read much commentary about electoral politics in Britain and you’ll quickly come across an inescapable narrative. What’s distinctive about the current moment, it goes, is that the Conservatives are the new party of the working class in England, while Labour’s electorate has been reduced to a rump of the city-dwelling, middle-class and “woke”. The crumbling of the “red wall” in the 2019 general election, and the recent Conservative triumph in the Hartlepool byelection, has elevated this myth to a near political religion.
There are figures in Labour who have uncritically swallowed this narrative, largely for factional reasons: in the party’s forever-war, portraying the left flank as bourgeois dilettantes who never left the student debating chamber is a convenient rhetorical device. It is, however, a deceit. As recent analysis underlined, in 2019, Labour won a higher share of the working-age population than the Tories; excluding retirees, it had a decisive lead with low-income workers and indeed triumphed in every income bracket except for those earning more than £100,000 a year. The Tories secured victory thanks to pensioners, who comprise a quarter of the electorate and are most likely to vote.

Anybody wanting to book a Covid test in the late morning on Gov.uk would have struggled. There is an alternative method, by phone, but who knows the number to call: 119? Government services that once delivered by form and post, then call centres, now only really exist through online connections.

We went on holiday for Christmas to a friend’s parents house in Marlo – a village in Victoria, Australia. We got there on Christmas Eve to find the only shop was pretty bare – so Christmas lunch was a frozen turkey roll, Fanta, chips and some frozen peas. I made a Christmas tree out of a stick and some toilet rolls, determined to be cheerful. On Christmas morning, I woke up and went outside. It was nice and hot – yay, beach day! Then I stepped on a very large brown snake on the doorstep and screamed. I found another snake in the lounge room, one in the toilet, and others all around the house. It was my idea of hell. I had no idea whether they were poisonous but it didn’t matter. I was terrified. Lesley Podesta, retired, Australia

There’s nothing quite so naff and depressing as a British comedy misfire, and Me, Myself and Di is the real deal: a miserably unfunny romcom about Bolton’s answer to Bridget Jones. Her name is Janet Brown (Katy Clayton), and she is a chirpy 30-year-old virgin who works in a supermarket stacking shelves. Janet is devastated when an internet date stands her up: “He took one look at me and ran off because I’m fat and ugly,” she sobs. “You’re not ugly,” quips her glam best friend Diana (Lucy Pinder), always ready to knock Janet’s self-confidence. The world lays indignities upon Janet and then film throws on some more. The character is so thinly written that there’s little for Clayton to do other than perform her with a kind of mouth-open gormlessness.
Most of the film is set at an annoyingly anachronistic holiday camp in Rhyl where the two friends go on holiday for a week. Diana gives Janet a makeover for the trip; transforming her into Jeanette De Brun (“It’s French, dead classy,” she reasons). The comedy here is meant to be affectionate social satire, I think. But it feels snidey: a mickey-take of working-class characters hilariously mispronouncing “Tenerife” and “Les Misérables”.

For months, Democrats in the US Senate have danced delicately around Joe Manchin, giving him space and holding out hope that the West Virginia Democrat would eventually come around and give his must-win vote to legislation that would amount to the most sweeping voting rights protections in a generation.

“I probably shouldn’t say this, but I’ve got a good feeling about tonight,” Nige tells me while waiting for a pint of Guinness. In a few minutes, the MC (real name Niall Williams) will take to the stage of London’s Jazz Cafe with the rest of the Nine8 Collective for their first live show in almost 18 months.
Tonight’s seated, socially distanced show isn’t a homecoming. The collective – left-field Gen-Z pop artists with a radically egalitarian setup – may be based in a studio in nearby Kentish Town but, according to rapper Lava La Rue (an anagram of her real name, Ava Laurel), “it doesn’t really feel like we’ve been away”, thanks to their sustained creativity during lockdown.

It was mid-2018 when a convicted narcotics importer met with FBI agents from San Diego and made them a tantalising offer: in exchange for a possible reduction in the importer’s sentence on other charges, would the bureau like a backdoor into the encrypted communications of a vast network of international organised crime groups?
The importer had invested a “substantial amount” of money in developing an encrypted device which could be used by criminals around the world to avoid the detection of police.

Jacob Kenedy’s home kitchen is full of things he rarely uses: a sushi mat, a coconut grater, a pestle and mortar, even a borrowed turbotière (a kite-shaped pan specifically for poaching turbot). “I’m the worst,” confesses the chef-owner at Bocca di Lupo in central London. “I buy gadgets all the time. I’m a kleptomaniac of other cuisines; I’ve an enormous kitchen island full of crap.”
Kenedy is not alone. In a survey last year, tapwarehouse.com found that 41% of tagine owners had never used theirs. Spiralizers, waffle-irons and juicers are all gathering dust, too, with the average household home to £311 of unused kitchen equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dumba has spent her life performing in circuses around Europe, but in recent years animal rights activists have been campaigning to rescue her. When it looked like they might succeed, Dumba and her owners disappeared 

One day in late September 2020, the Kludsky family – Yvonne, a slim, blond woman in her 60s, her husband, George, who is over 80 but still fit and strong, and their son Martyn – led their elephant up a ramp into the 10-metre trailer that constituted her second home. Dumba went willingly, as always; it was her owners who dragged their feet. The family had spent much of their lives on the road, but this time they did not know how long they would be gone, or if they would ever return.
The Kludskys’ home is on the outskirts of Caldes de Montbui, a spa town north of Barcelona. Set amid farmland and hills, the property forms part of a secluded residential development. Until recently, they had spent at least half of the year, travelling across Europe with Dumba, performing in circuses and zoos or hiring her out for media work – including a TV ad in which she lumbered gracefully across a mattress to demonstrate the product’s durability (“A Pikolin can take anything”). Yvonne, whose professional name is Yvonne Kruse, is a fourth-generation circus performer, while George is sixth-generation circus, and they have worked with Dumba for 41 years, since she was brought to Europe from Asia at the age of two. “She is our daughter and we are her herd,” Kruse likes to say.

To most people, the horror of 21 lives being lost during a race across 100km in a Chinese mountain range will have been amplified by how obscure the sport seems to outsiders. But ultrarunning has boomed in popularity in recent years, with the number of finishers around the world rising from 120,000 to more than 600,000 in a decade. Now there are concerns that in China and beyond, a proliferation of new races has created a risk that safety rules will not always be enforced, and with it a chance that some of the most obsessive participants will discard vital protective equipment in the interests of gaining an advantage over their rivals.
Rachel Humphreys talks to Outside magazine’s Will Ford about the tragedy in China, and whether the decision of the government there to ban all extreme sports is the right response. And she hears from the author and ultrarunner Adharanand Finn about the extraordinary appeal of this brutally difficult feat of endurance – and how any analysis of its dangers must sit alongside an understanding of its power to change its devotees’ lives in profound ways.

One year ago, the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston was brought down in Bristol, prompting jubilation among protesters and calls for a wider rethink of public memorials – but also a ferocious backlash.

When mice started breeding in large numbers in New South Wales more than six months ago, residents went to war to repel them. Now they have reached a grim acceptance of their presence – and are counting the costs of a “plague” that has seen crops ravaged and homes ruined.
Rachel Humphreys spoke to Matilda Boseley, who has been reporting on the story, about how the mice came, what damage they have caused, and how difficult it is to get rid of them. And we hear residents’ accounts of what life is like with thousands of mice underfoot, in hay bales, and even in the washing machine.
