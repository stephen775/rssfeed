Viral videos of impassioned parents denouncing critical race theory at school board hearings have become a cornerstone of the movement to ban its teaching.
In one such video, a mother declares critical race theory (CRT) to be “a tactic used by Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan on slavery very many years ago to dumb down my ancestors so we could not think for ourselves”. In another, a woman calls CRT “the American version of the Chinese cultural revolution”. A third mother says she has proof that her local school board is “teaching our children to go out and murder police officers”.

Businesses and public bodies have been warned by the Brexit rights regulator not to discriminate against EU citizens as the new post-Brexit immigration regime enters into force at midnight.
The warnings come as Home Office helplines for EU citizens living in the UK were reported to be “jammed” by a last-minute surge in EU citizens applying to remain in the UK by the midnight deadline. Charity workers helping applicants said they were also struggling to get through to the specialist hotline reserved for advisers.

“We are committed to leading the necessary changes to help fight online scammers,” trumpeted Google’s UK managing director, Ronan Harris, this week, as if the tech giant were somehow a pioneer of a crackdown on online financial fraud and adverts offering “bonds” with implausibly high rates of interest.
The reality is that Google’s harder approach has taken an age to appear. It was 18 months ago that the frustration of Andrew Bailey, then the chief executive of the FCA, boiled over. He called for “more assistance from the big internet service companies, particularly Google” on taking down obviously dodgy adverts quickly. If a bank or a regulated financial institution had received such a public shaming, immediate action would be expected.

The Resolution Foundation said the chancellor’s decision to wind down furlough support for employers from today would endanger the jobs of more than one in four workers aged 55 to 64 who have remained on the scheme since the recent lockdown.

Donald Rumsfeld, who has died aged 88, arguably did more damage to the US’s military reputation than any previous secretary of defence. An unbendingly ideological approach to international affairs, and a conviction that he could micromanage the vast resources of the Pentagon like those of a private company, ensured not only that the US became enmeshed in a disastrous and costly campaign in Iraq from 2003 but that it would be vilified for its harsh treatment of the country’s citizens.
As the war dragged on with little sign of progress and pressure grew for him to be replaced, President George W Bush initially declared that Rumsfeld would hold his post until the end of the presidency in January 2009. But in November 2006, in the aftermath of the scandal of torture and abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib military detention centre in Baghdad, the Army Times, voice of an outraged military, roundly declared that “Rumsfeld has lost credibility with the uniformed leadership, with the troops, with Congress and with the public at large. His strategy has failed, and his ability to lead is compromised.”

There was the burst away from Thomas Müller and in between Antonio Rüdiger and Toni Kroos, the ability to feel the seam of space and blast into it, and then the pass up to Harry Kane. He continued his run and, when Kane went left to Jack Grealish, Sterling darted for the through ball. It was not on. Then came the best bit.

The England captain had drawn blanks in each of the three group-stage game and attracted criticism for the level of his all-round game. Against Germany, he worked around the edges of a tight match but the moment he had dreamed of came on 86 minutes.

Dunkley hits 73 not out, Kate Cross takes five for 34

England clawed their way to a five-wicket win in the second one‑day international at Taunton with 15 balls to spare, coming out on top in a close contest against India thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Sophia Dunkley, who played with a confidence belying the fact that her debut in the format had come only three days previously.
Earlier the seamer Kate Cross had claimed five for 34 – the best by any England bowler on home soil since Anya Shrubsole’s six for 46 in the 2017 World Cup final – as India were bowled out for 221.

A First Nations community in western Canada has discovered the remains of nearly 200 people on the grounds of a former residential school, adding to the growing tally of unmarked graves across the country.
The Lower Kootenay Band said on Wednesday that ground-penetrating radar had revealed 182 human remains at St Eugene’s Mission residential school, near the city of Cranbrook, British Columbia. Some of the remains were buried in shallow graves only three and four feet deep.

Pennsylvania’s highest court overturned Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction on Wednesday after finding an agreement with a previous prosecutor prevented him from being charged in the case.
Cosby has served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. He had vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse over the 2004 encounter with accuser Andrea Constand.

Tottenham have appointed Nuno Espírito Santo as their new manager after a protracted search to find a permanent replacement for José Mourinho. Nuno, who left Wolves at the end of the season in May, has signed a two-year deal.
Mourinho was sacked in April, with Ryan Mason being put in temporary charge. After that Spurs have held talks with a number of candidates including Antonio Conte and Gennaro Gattuso, without being able to find an agreement. Tottenham finally turned to another Portuguese.

Mack – best known for her role as a young Superman’s close friend on the series Smallville – had previously pleaded guilty to the charges and was expected to seek credit for cooperating against the Nxivm leader, Keith Raniere, and taking responsibility for helping him create a secret society of brainwashed women who were branded with his initials.

James Franco has agreed to pay $2.2m to settle a class-action lawsuit for allegedly pushing his former film students to perform increasingly explicit sex scenes on camera. The settlement, first revealed by the Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday, will go before a Los Angeles judge for approval.
The agreement comes less than a year after two of Franco’s former students, Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, filed a complaint alleging students of the Oscar-nominated actor, 43, at his Studio 4 Film School were victims of fraud. Tither-Kaplan was one of five women to go on the record with the Los Angeles Times for a January 2018 report which detailed allegations of Franco’s inappropriate or sexually exploitative behavior on set. Franco has repeatedly denied the allegations.

The communications consultant Jessica Morris did much to give a voice to people who lacked one. In the years up to her death at the age of 57 from brain cancer, she made her illness the basis of a campaign to find treatments for others.
In January 2016 she was hiking in a valley north of New York when she found herself trying to speak: “Sounds came out of my mouth, but they weren’t words,” she said later. That seizure led to a diagnosis of glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain cancer, for which the median survival rate is 14 months. Only 5% of patients survive for five years.

His comments are the clearest official signal yet that disagreements between the US and Iran on how such a guarantee might be constructed remain a serious obstacle. Donald Trump took the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018, only three years afterhis predecessor, Barack Obama, had signed it.

“There was a famous performance in Minneapolis of my piece Dance,” says Lucinda Childs. “Practically no one was in the audience by the end.” She laughs. “We had the same with a Robert Wilson play I was in. We’d look out and see … ‘Well, his sister is there, but that’s about it.’”
The choreographer’s work, including the minimalist classic Dance (1979) set to the music of Philip Glass, the John Adams-scored Available Light (1983) and in Glass’s opera Einstein on the Beach (1976), may not have always been appreciated by everyone – “in the US it wasn’t something people could deal with” – but she’s now recognised as a seminal figure. She’s most associated with the Judson Dance Theater and New York’s downtown arts scene of the 60s and 70s, a hub of radical musicians, artists, performers, cheap loft studios and experimental happenings. But Childs has worked steadily since, particularly in Europe, and latterly as an opera director, too.

Inevitably, it would be the attackers who grabbed the headlines. Amid the uncorked pandemonium of England’s 2-0 win against Germany on Tuesday, perhaps it was only natural that the defining motifs would be of England’s two goalscorers. The gnarled, gritted features of Harry Kane, staring out from Wednesday morning’s front pages like a king restored to his throne. The stern thousand-yard stare of Raheem Sterling adorning a thousand memes and highlights reels, daring you to doubt him ever again.
But perhaps the most interesting element of England’s night of jubilee at Wembley was that on first glance it didn’t appear to have an obvious architect. Above all, England’s win was a very collegiate sort of triumph, studded with fine performances and nervelessly mapped out by Gareth Southgate. Yet to single out individuals is really to miss the essence of what made England so effective.

The purpose of Brexit is summarised by its advocates in a word – sovereignty. In practice, that means the power to enact laws that European Union membership would forbid. With the exception of border control, the leave campaign avoided spelling out what those legal departures might be.
The picture is coming into focus. On Wednesday, the government described the outline for a system of industrial subsidy. These rules will replace the state aid regime by which Brussels enforces a level economic playing field between member states. The theory is that a nimble, proactive state can make strategic interventions to support up-and-coming sectors, enhancing British competitiveness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The discovery of hundreds of graves of Indigenous children is forcing a deeper reckoning with the country’s past
It is hard to fathom the full horror of what happened in Canada’s church-run residential schools for over a century: systematic abuse and mistreatment, on an industrial scale, with an estimated 150,000 Indigenous children ripped from their homes. The last school closed in 1996. Thousands have since testified to widespread sexual and physical abuse, forced labour on starvation rations, the eradication of their language and culture, and diseases allowed to run rampant. Some witnesses even spoke of killings. The 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report called it cultural genocide.
But it has taken the discovery of hundreds of children’s bodies to fully awaken Canada. On Wednesday, the remains of 182 people were found at a former school in British Columbia – weeks after 215 unmarked graves were found at an institution in the province and 751 in Saskatchewan. Murray Sinclair, who led the TRC, suggests as many as 15,000 died – one in 10 of the students. Since the state funded over 130 schools, and many more were run by churches, others believe the toll could be much higher.

Plus letters from Prof Richard Carter, Alan Marsden, Chris Sinha and Susannah Woodgate
I am an NHS nurse who has worked in acute areas throughout the pandemic and am mystified as to why the enhanced effectiveness of FFP3 masks is now being reported as a surprising piece of new information (Cambridge hospital’s mask upgrade appears to eliminate Covid risk to staff, 29 June). NHS staff have been making this point since the beginning of the pandemic.
The PPE crisis is a scandal. Coronavirus was downgraded from a high consequence infectious disease early on in the outbreak, just before the first national lockdown, despite it meeting the criteria set out by the World Health Organization. This meant that NHS trusts have been able to stand behind Public Health England guidance and send staff into red zones without full PPE, and many continue to do so. It is not unlikely that numerous health and social care staff have contracted Covid and died as a result of this policy, and many more are now struggling with long Covid.

In a move that sparked anger from school leaders, Downing Street said decisions about which pupils should be sent home can be made on a “case-by-case basis” and that schools needed to better “understand this”.

An email sent by a senior civil servant last year said there was a dedicated email address for offers to supply PPE from people who had been recommended by a minister or senior official. It was later publicly confirmed that a “VIP lane” or “high-priority route” existed for PPE offers. More attention was paid to those companies that were referred by ministers, MPs or officials.

For a generation who came of age with both the post-Scream slasher resurgence of the late 90s and the pre-YA boom in teen-focused horror novels that started before it (at least before the term YA was widely used), the arrival of this summer’s ambitious Fear Street trilogy will bring with it a sense of giddy excitement.
The promise of an R-rated set of slashers based on the hit franchise from RL Stine, the “Stephen King of children’s literature”, focused on high schoolers grappling with a murder mystery, carries with it a cautious throwback charm, ultimate success being heavily dependent on a vital mastering of tone. How to rebrand a goofy Scooby Doo-adjacent story aimed at younger teens as a scary, and violent, triptych of shockers to be taken seriously by a wider audience, whose horror diet is far more advanced and overstuffed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Netflix drama centres on the people who are usually peripheral casualties in crime shows like Narcos – the residents of Allende, who were all killed in a horrific real-life massacre
For years, nobody knew exactly what happened in March 2011 in Allende, a humdrum Mexican town half an hour from the Texas border. That is, they only knew the basic, horrific story: when an associate of the Zetas crime cartel was found to have double-crossed his bosses, his punishment was not just his own death but the murder of anyone connected to him, plus scores of innocent Allende residents. The massacre, during which victims were robbed, kidnapped, shot and then burned, took dozens – or maybe even hundreds – of lives. But in a part of the world where justice is a hazy concept and talking out of turn can be fatal, the details remained vague.
That all changed in 2017 when ProPublica published an oral history of the Allende killings by the Pulitzer-winning journalist Ginger Thompson; a podcast, The Making of a Massacre, followed in 2018; and now Netflix has a six-episode dramatisation, Somos. The title translates as “we are” or “we exist”, which is a clue to the show’s motivations: with the atrocity not taking place until the final instalment, this is a show not only about what happened, but who it happened to.

Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has fired a health ministry official who reportedly asked for a bribe in a vaccine deal, the latest graft accusation to rock the government amid investigations of its pandemic response.
With over half a million Covid-19 deaths and more new cases daily than any other country, anger is mounting in Brazil over missed opportunities to buy coronavirus vaccines. Accusations of corruption undercutting efforts have poured fuel on the fire, triggering new calls for Bolsonaro’s impeachment.

Mark Drakeford is right. The threat to the UK’s union must be treated as a major question of our time. Wales’s Labour first minister says the union has failed to keep pace with devolution and is fracturing before his eyes. From Cardiff, Drakeford sees little sign that the UK government is remotely bothered.
Boris Johnson’s “aggressive unilateralism” was making things worse, the first minister said on Monday, the taste for “slogans, buildings and flag-flying” boosting separatism. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Differences should be a source of strength, and could be, if Britain had the devolutionary reset that it needs. Drakeford makes this case from a position of renewed strength, having seen off both the anti-devolutionists and the separatists in May’s assembly elections.

Two things particularly have always drawn me in my work: teenagers and costumes. I am interested in the age, around 16 and 17, that is full of transition. During those years there is confusion everywhere: confusion about roles, confusion about gender. There are a lot of changes for people to deal with.
In 2008, I travelled to Ukraine to take pictures of kids during the week of their prom that marks the end of their school years. They are very young but they are entering a stage in their lives where they are expected to act like adults. The prom is an example of this. They don’t always feel comfortable in the clothes they’re wearing.

The announcement of a mutually agreed temporary fix to the problem of whether British bangers can be sold in Northern Ireland has to be seen as a positive.

Until Tuesday evening I had watched every single competitive football encounter between England and Germany, the majority of which I had not enjoyed very much. This one would have been different if I had been able to watch it, but I wasn’t. It was my daughter’s school-leaving ceremony and I just had to be there. When I say “had to”, I’m afraid I don’t mean it in the sense that I couldn’t possibly miss it as I’m a devoted father and generally a good person; I mean it in the sense that she had made clear to me that I had to be there or she would never forgive me.
I watched the first half at home, got to the school on my motorbike during half-time, and managed to catch the first 18 minutes of the second half on my phone standing outside pretending to wait for someone. As the event kicked off, full-time at Wembley was still 20 minutes away; the score was 0-0. I started to wonder whether we would finish in time to see the inevitable penalty shootout. During the opening speeches I heard a passenger plane overhead and was selfishly glad that others were missing out, too. And they couldn’t even check their phones up there; truly, there’s always someone worse off than yourself.

None of them would have thought that in 30 years’ time the organisation they had founded would rule the nation, or that in 100 years’ time it would be the world’s largest political party, with nearly 92 million members – today also an enigma to many outsiders.

In the early 1990s, Pride marches in London looked dramatically different from the Pride we know now. Rather than spilling into every crevice of the city, with corporate floats and sponsored stages, the event was a protest march through the capital, ending in a festival-like party in a park, its location moving each year from Kennington to Brockwell to Victoria Park to Clapham Common. The events were also significantly more politicised, with notable demonstrations against Section 28, government negligence in addressing the HIV/Aids crisis, and discrimination against LGBT+ parents.
But what is often overlooked in the history of Pride in the UK is the significant Black presence, and the spaces Black LGBT+ people sought to carve out for themselves among the “mainstream” gay and lesbian community.

But now that “The Saj” (does anyone ever really call him that?) is back in the great game, replacing Matt Hancock as health and social care secretary (not officially one of the so-called great offices of state, though after the past year and a half it surely should be) what should we expect?

There is a general consensus that the best Netflix true crime series – now virtually a genre in themselves – comprise all or most of the following: an appalling central crime; multiple suspects; an almost equally appalling miscarriage of justice and a consequent re-examination that leads to justice. The original for this template was 2015’s Making a Murderer. By these lights, it was also the best, but there have been many more since – covering abuse in the Catholic church, abductions and infamous and unfamous cases alike.
Now we have Sophie: A Murder in West Cork, a three-part film made by John Dower with the blessing and cooperation of Sophie Toscan du Plantier’s family. At the time of her death, just before Christmas 25 years ago, the French television producer was staying in her holiday home in the tiny Irish town of Schull. In a remote corner of the south-west of the country, it is overlooked by Mount Gabriel, which, local legend has it, was the home until the 18th century of the last wolves in Ireland. It was there that her head was bludgeoned with a concrete block, her body found a day later tangled in briars. “I can still see her now, clear as day,” says Eugene Gilligan, the Garda forensic detective who was called to the scene. It was the first murder there in living memory.

With time on my hands over the last 14 months, and with a growing sense that we need to nurture and support the environment, we set about creating a more productive garden for wildlife. We dug a large wildlife pond, planted it with native species, and edged it with rocks repurposed from an old rockery. The spoil heap has been shaped and sown with wildflower and grass seeds for wildlife to enjoy. The pond has become a haven for dragonflies and damselflies, diving beetles, frogs, toads, birds and other animals: so far we’ve spotted a hopeful heron, a duck, deer and a hare. It is a very tranquil place to sit and think. Catherine Woolfe, marketing director, Bedfordshire

Ebrahim Raisi, winner of Iran’s presidential election, bears responsibility for the deaths of thousands of prisoners in Iranian jails in late 1988. He served as a prosecution member of a three-man “death committee” – as prisoners later termed it – which ordered executions of male and female members of an opposition group, and then of males who were atheists, communists or otherwise leftwing “apostates”. Women in this category were tortured until they recanted, or else died after continual whippings.
Raisi, only 28 at the time, was Tehran’s deputy prosecutor and alternated on the committee with his chief. Last week, facing questions on the subject, he claimed: “All the actions I have taken have always been in defence of human rights against those who disrupted the rights of humans.” In a lecture in 2018, he is reported to have referred to the killings as “one of the proud achievements of the system”.

As the fallout from the Matt Hancock affair continues, questions have been raised about the UK’s system of checks and balances on ministerial behaviour. There is a range of bodies inside and outside government that can scrutinise the actions of ministers – but all too often they can be circumvented by a prime minister with a comfortable majority.
While Hancock may have resigned because of his failure to abide by the Covid rules he put into law, his affair with Gina Coladangelo raised wider questions about the inadequacies of other rules. Coladangelo was not simply an aide – she was a non-executive director in his department. Neds, in Whitehall jargon, are people brought in from outside government to sit on the boards of government departments, scrutinising how they are run. Neds are supposed to declare any conflicts of interest, but as nothing has been published, there is no record of whether her longstanding friendship with Hancock was considered a conflict (or the potential conflict of interest posed by her brother’s job at a company that has won an NHS contract).

I’ve always quietly assumed I didn’t like churros. Quietly, because to deny the attraction of these hot, crisp, sugar-dusted sticks of deep-fried dough is surely to reveal oneself as the worst kind of joyless grinch. To my relief, however, it turns out it’s the Spanish habit of eating them for breakfast that was the problem to my Marmite-loving palate – after 11am, I’m a fully paid-up member of the cinnamon-scented, greasy-fingered churros appreciation society.
Popular throughout the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world in a variety of forms, from huge spirals to delicate twists, churros are often said to have been brought to the Iberian peninsula from China, though fried dough has been eaten in the region since classical times – the contentious pairing with chocolate is a legacy of the brutal Spanish conquest of the Americas. With a Madrid chocolatería almost as far away right now as a stand in a Manila mall or a Colombian street stall, I bring you the good news that the best churros are the freshest churros – and they’re almost as easy to make as they are to eat.

Shygirl’s tracks are, for want of a better word, filthy. The 28-year-old musician’s lyrics detail sexual exploits and disposable partners. “I like to glide, figure skate,” is not about ice dancing. This week she releases BDE, a collaboration with Northampton rapper Slowthai, and it’s less rapping on her part, more an intoxicating mix of cooed and snarled commands over ominous production. This is sex as chaotic workout, and if it ends up jarring the listener, the artist has achieved her goal. “I love it when art makes me uncomfortable, because I have to question where that’s from,” she says. “How can something affect my equilibrium like that? I want to affect other people’s equilibrium.”
Her domineering musical persona is worlds away from the chatty, pleasant woman I meet in a bar outside Cambridge University’s Union, where she has just given a talk about her artistry and the accessibility of the creative industries. About a quarter of our time is spent laughing; sharp introspections on owning one’s narrative as a public figure come as easily as self-deprecating tales of recording angry voice notes about previous partners. And it’s easy to see why she’s increasingly considered a fashion force: following a recent Burberry campaign and soundtracking runways for Thierry Mugler, she stands out majestically via orange hair, wholesome babydoll dress and eye-catching Telfar Clemens boots, noticed by wide-eyed students in our vicinity.

I’m 18 years old and have been diagnosed with Asperger’s. I’m really worried it will affect my chance of having a fulfilling relationship and sex life. I’m considering getting into online dating, as some friends have had success in that regard, but my issues with speaking with others and body language make it a tough proposition. Most of my interactions with new people have been instigated by friends, family, educators or employers. I worry that, without telling potential partners of my condition, I’ll come across as weird and sexually incapable. It’s a gamble that I’ve had to make many times – whether to let people know or wait for them to find out on their own. When it comes to such a nuanced and complex social situation as dating and sex, I feel I’m just not built for it. What can I do to help my chances of happiness in this field?
Your question shows that you already have a good understanding of your potential sex and relationship challenges. But even though you have received a specific diagnosis, you are still a unique human being with much to offer the right partner. Instead of asking yourself: “Will I be acceptable to others?” instead consider the far more important universal questions: “What do I need in a relationship, sexual or otherwise? And how can I best find a loving and consensual way to get my needs met as well as helping to meet the needs of someone I might care about?”

When Channel 4 launched at 4.45pm on Tuesday 2 November 1982, Nancy Banks-Smith in the Guardian worried that some of the programmes were “trendy enough to make the teeth peel”. Yet Channel 4 wasn’t designed to be trendy. It was established by Margaret Thatcher to shake up telly and, in particular, nobble the BBC. She even contemplated TV sets that could only broadcast ITV and Channel 4. “If she hadn’t hated the BBC so much,” said the TV producer Stewart Mackinnon, “she would not have created Channel 4. But she did.”
Like many a Thatcher’s child, Channel 4 went rogue. After a sedate debut in the form of the gameshow Countdown – still going strong 7,500 episodes later, with a new host, Anne Robinson – it was soon effing and jeffing, going cold turkey and staying up late watching mucky foreign films. In the light of all this, the only surprising thing about the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, dangling the possibility of Channel 4 being privatised is that it has taken the Tories so long to get round to taking it down.

Wolfgang Tillmans and I talk on the phone on 23 June, which he calls the “fifth anniversary horribilis”, referring to the Brexit vote. He’s at home in Berlin: a day later, he will travel to the UK to install his new exhibition, Moon in Earthlight, in the seaside town of Hove. To conform to Covid protocols, he’ll be doing it on his own, without his usual assistants, carefully placing his photographic images around the space – a former Regency flat owned by his gallerist Maureen Paley.
These photographs range from an image of wet concrete pouring out of a nozzle to one of a root’s tendrils creeping along a gap in the pavement. They are presented in a variety of formats, from huge printouts suspended on bulldog clips to small photographs tacked to the wall. Like all his shows, Moon in Earthlight will serve as an installation in its own right, a manifestation of Tillmans’ tender scrutiny of the universe. It also includes a collection of astronomical yearbooks dating back to 1978, when the artist was a stargazing 10-year-old.

A normal sunny day in June would see the Tower of London as busy as a beehive, with 50 or more of the capital’s Blue Badge guides leading tour groups around the Jewel House and the Bloody Tower. Since it reopened on 19 May, the Tower has seen just a handful of tours, and Britain’s tour guides are facing a bleak time as the pandemic enters its second summer.
The first year of Covid was devastating for the tour guiding industry. Tourism from overseas collapsed, locals went into lockdown, and social distancing rules left guides without a single booking. Now, with the crisis in its second year, many are wondering how long the industry can survive without any tourists to guide.

Forest protection carbon offsets that may have no benefit to the climate have been used by polluters to avoid paying carbon taxes in Colombia, according to a report.
In 2016, a levy of about $5 (£3.60) was introduced in the South American country to cover the use of some fossil fuels. However, companies that emit carbon dioxide can avoid paying the tax by buying carbon offsets from Colombian emission reduction projects, including those that conserve threatened natural carbon banks such as peatlands, forests and mangrove swamps.

Full Story: ‘The pain can feel like an evil flower blossoming inside me’

Sometimes it hits in the middle of hot yoga. One moment I’m working hard, dripping sweat; the next I’m flat on my back in corpse pose, trying – usually failing – to practise calm acceptance. When the class ends I might need help rolling up my mat.
A few months back the first twinges flared when I was the designated driver at a family gathering. I felt like a demented cattle dog trying to round up the drinkers, barking at them to skip goodbyes so I could get us home before it smashed me.

Last week, I witnessed a wondrous and slightly horrifying spectacle of nature.
I was admiring a swallowtail, Britain’s largest native butterfly, as it jinked over a waterway on the Norfolk Broads. Suddenly, an emperor dragonfly cruised in and grabbed the butterfly. There was a mid-air tussle for five seconds, before the iridescent blue dragonfly dropped into the reed bed with its prize.

Just after 5am, she stood at a corner, well away from any street lights. “I’m here,” she tapped into her phone. Seconds later, her phone pinged back. “I’m coming, I’m carrying a green bag. Please wait for me.”

When the Labour candidate Tracy Brabin won the race to be mayor of West Yorkshire in May, it meant she had to give up her seat in parliament representing Batley and Spen. The resulting byelection takes place tomorrow and the race to replace her as MP is far from assured for Labour. Their candidate Kim Leadbeater is sister of Jo Cox, the Batley and Spen MP murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016. 
Maya Wolfe-Robinson tells Anushka Asthana how she has been visiting the constituency for weeks and describes an increasingly fraught campaign, which was upended by the entry of former Labour MP George Galloway into the race. His candidacy threatens to split the Labour vote by appealing directly to the area’s Muslim population on issues such as Palestinian rights and the crisis in Kashmir. Meanwhile, the Conservative candidate Ryan Stephenson is hoping to benefit from a reduced Labour vote that would allow him to add to Boris Johnson’s majority and take a seat last won by his party in 1992.

When Britain awoke on Friday morning to tabloid pictures of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in a ‘steamy clinch’ with a colleague, it was clear that his career hung by a thread. He had been a harsh critic of other prominent figures breaking lockdown rules, and here was what appeared to be a clear breach of his own social distancing guidelines. Later that day he was given the backing of the prime minister, who considered the matter closed. It was anything but. 
The following morning saw the release of a full CCTV version of the incident in his office, and on the airwaves there was a distinct lack of colleagues willing to support him. Later that day his resignation letter was accepted by Boris Johnson. Hancock was gone.

In 2017, Harriet Gibsone was a music journalist for the Guardian – working hard, going out lots, and just married. She was ready for her 30s, but not quite ready for a family.
Then, at 31, she started to experience symptoms she couldn’t make sense of: forgetfulness, mysterious mood swings and bouts of weeping, and being woken in the night by sudden hot flushes. The sudden bursts of aggression made her feel like Piers Morgan. Her world was crumbling – but nobody could tell her exactly what was wrong.

It was just one of 13 anti-trans bills conservative lawmakers in the US passed this year – and one of more than 110 proposed bills, many of which also target access to gender-affirming healthcare. This is by far the largest number filed in a single year in US history.
Guardian LA correspondent, Sam Levin, and Prof Jules Gill-Peterson, a historian and expert on trans kids, examine how this legislative attack has escalated and how the presence of trans kids in America is not a new phenomenon

The 39-year-old delivered an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court on Wednesday 23 June, saying she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and from having her IUD birth control removed so she could try to have another child. She added: 'I just want my life back.'
Her allegations were detailed and disturbing, and will fuel the growing #FreeBritney movement, as Guardian US correspondent Sam Levin explains.
